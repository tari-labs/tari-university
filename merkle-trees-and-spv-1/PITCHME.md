# Introduction to Simple Payment Verification (SPV), Merkle Trees and Bloom Filters

# Types of Validating Nodes : Full Node
  * Stores the all blocks in the longest chain  
  * Size is a problem

# Types of Validating Nodes: Simple Payment Verification (SPV) client
* Examples: miner, wallets
* Only have block headers and asks a full node for blocks as they are needed
* If the block is in the longest chain and 6 blocks deep, it's accepted as valid

---

# Inefficient SPV implementation
* Only store block headers
* When a transaction is needed, download the entire block
* Hash to compare it to header to determine if valid
> Do we really need the entire block to verify a single transaction?

---
# Merkle Trees (and more importantly branches)

* A binary tree structure where:
  * Data is stored in the leaf nodes
  * A non-leaf node is the hash of it's 2 descendants
* Most importantly, descendant nodes can be pruned, leaving the rest of the tree's hash integrity intact.
* This means we only need the Merkle branch with the transaction we want to verify

> Non-binary Merkle trees also exist

# SPV and Merkle Branches

* SPV client request Merkle Branch from full node for transactions. 
* SPV client checks the Merkle Root against block header
* SPV client checks that block is at correct depth

---
# Privacy Problems
* When wallets only request transactions to the addresses it owns, full nodes will become aware of the owner
* To mitigate this, Bloom Filters can be used

--- 
# Bloom Filters

* Provide filtering when receiving blocks
* Provides privacy

--- 
# Bloom Filter Implementation
* Start with empty array of _m_ bits

![Bloom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/mikethetike-merkle-trees/merkle-trees-and-spv-1/sources/bloom-empty.png)

---

# Bloom Filter Implementation

* Hash the data to filter on (e.g. public address) using _k_ hash functions to a value between 0 and _m_
* Set those bits in the array
* In this example, _k_ = 2

![Bloom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/mikethetike-merkle-trees/merkle-trees-and-spv-1/sources/bloom-0.png)

---
# Bloom Filter Implementation

* Repeat for more filter criteria, or to obscure the original filter
![Bloom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/mikethetike-merkle-trees/merkle-trees-and-spv-1/sources/bloom-1.png)

* Then send the filter to the full node

---
# Bloom Filter Implementation

* Whenever the full node would relay a block, it uses the same _k_ hash functions and checks for an intersect on the filter.
* If there are no 0's hit, then the transaction is removed from the Merkle Tree before forwarding to the client
  * Empty blocks are not forwarded

![Bloom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/mikethetike-merkle-trees/merkle-trees-and-spv-1/sources/bloom-3.png)

---
# Bloom Filter Implementation

* If there are transactions that must be forwarded, the pruned Merkle Tree is forwarded
* There may be false positives included, which the client will filter out
* This hides the actual filter criteria from any full nodes
