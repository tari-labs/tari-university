<p>Below are a list of terms and their definitions that are used throughout the Tari code and documentation. Let's use this
glossary to disambiguate ideas, and work towards a
<a href="https://blog.carbonfive.com/2016/10/04/ubiquitous-language-the-joy-of-naming/" target="_blank">ubiquitous language</a> for this project.</p>
<h3 id="archive-node"><a href="#archive-node">Archive node</a></h3>
<p>This is a full history <a href="#base-node" title="A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions
and blocks">base node</a>. It will keep a complete history of every transaction ever received and it will not
implement pruning.</p>
<h3 id="assetcollateral"><a href="#assetcollateral">AssetCollateral</a></h3>
<p>The amount of tari coin that a <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">Validator Node</a> must put up on the <a href="#base-layer" title="The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work">base layer</a> in order to become part of an asset
<a href="#committee" title="A group of validator nodes that are responsible for managing a specific Digital Asset">committee</a>.</p>
<h3 id="asset-issuer"><a href="#asset-issuer">Asset Issuer</a></h3>
<p>An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN. The Asset Issuer will specify the parameters of the contract
template that defines the rules that govern the asset and the number and nature of its constituent tokens on issuance.
The Asset Issuer will, generally, be the initial owner of the tokens.</p>
<h3 id="bad-actor"><a href="#bad-actor">Bad Actor</a></h3>
<p>A participant that acts maliciously or negligently to the detriment of the network or another participant.</p>
<h3 id="base-layer"><a href="#base-layer">Base layer</a></h3>
<p>The Tari Base layer is a merge-mined <a href="#blockchain" title="The linked sequence of Tari blocks on the Tari base layer">blockchain</a> secured by proof-of-work. The base layer is primarily responsible for
the emission of new Tari, for securing and managing <a href="#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a> transfers.</p>
<h3 id="base-node"><a href="#base-node">Base Node</a></h3>
<p>A full Tari node running on the base layer. It's primary role is validating and propagating <a href="#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a> transactions
and blocks to the rest of the network.</p>
<h3 id="block"><a href="#block">Block</a></h3>
<p>A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain. The ordering of
Tari transactions is set purely by the block height of the block they are recorded in.</p>
<h3 id="block-header"><a href="#block-header">Block Header</a></h3>
<p>A data structure that validates the information contained in a <a href="#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a>.</p>
<h3 id="block-body"><a href="#block-body">Block Body</a></h3>
<p>A data structure containing the transaction inputs, outputs, and kernels that make up the block.</p>
<h3 id="block-reward"><a href="#block-reward">Block reward</a></h3>
<p>The amount of Tari created by the coinbase transaction in every block. The block reward is set by the
<a href="#emission-schedule">emission schedule</a>.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain"><a href="#blockchain">Blockchain</a></h3>
<p>A sequence of tari <a href="#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a>s. Each block contains a hash of the previous valid block. Thus the blocks form a chain
with the property that changing anything in a block other than the head block requires rewriting the entire
blockchain from that point on.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-state"><a href="#blockchain-state">Blockchain state</a></h3>
<p>The complete state of the blockchain at a specific block height. This means a pruned <a href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">utxo</a> set, a complete set of
kernels and headers up to that block height from the genesis block.</p>
<h3 id="broadcaststrategy"><a href="#broadcaststrategy">BroadcastStrategy</a></h3>
<p>A strategy for propagating messages amongst nodes in a peer-to-peer network. Example implementations of
<code>BroadcastStrategy</code> include the Gossip protocol and flood fill.</p>
<h3 id="chain-reorganization"><a href="#chain-reorganization">Chain Reorganization</a></h3>
<p>A chain reorganization occurs after a chain split occurs on the network, which commonly occurs due to network latency
and connectivity issues. When a chain split occurs one chain will have the higher accumulated proof-of-work, this chain
is considered the best chain. Nodes on the poorer chain will need to rewind and resync their chains to best chain. In
this process transaction in the mempool could become orphaned or invalid.</p>
<h3 id="checkpoint"><a href="#checkpoint">Checkpoint</a></h3>
<p>A hash of the state of a Digital Asset that is recorded on the base layer.</p>
<h3 id="coinbase-transaction"><a href="#coinbase-transaction">Coinbase transaction</a></h3>
<p>The first transaction in every Tari block yields a <a href="#block-reward" title="The amount of Tari created in every block">Block Reward</a> according to the Tari <a href="#emission-schedule">emission Schedule</a> and is
awarded to the miner that performed the Proof of Work for the block.</p>
<h3 id="committee"><a href="#committee">Committee</a></h3>
<p>A group of <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">Validator Node</a>s that are responsible for managing the state of a specific <a href="#digital-asset" title="Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">Digital Asset</a>. A committee is
selected during asset issuance and can be updated at <a href="#checkpoint" title="A summary of the state of a Digital Asset that is recorded on the base layer">Checkpoint</a>s.</p>
<h3 id="committeeselectionstrategy"><a href="#committeeselectionstrategy">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a></h3>
<p>A strategy for an Asset Issuer to select candidates for the committee from the available registered Validator Nodes who
responded to the nomination call for that asset.</p>
<h3 id="consensusstrategy"><a href="#consensusstrategy">ConsensusStrategy</a></h3>
<p>The approach that will be taken for a committee to reach consensus on the validity of instructions that are performed
on a given Digital Asset.</p>
<h3 id="commitment"><a href="#commitment">Commitment</a></h3>
<p>A commitment is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from
others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. Commitments are designed so that one cannot change the
value or statement after they have committed to it.</p>
<h3 id="communication-node"><a href="#communication-node">Communication Node</a></h3>
<p>A Communication Node is either a Validator Node or Base Node that is part of the Tari communication network. It
maintains the network and is responsible for forwarding and propagating joining requests, discovery requests and data
messages on the communication network.</p>
<h3 id="communication-client"><a href="#communication-client">Communication Client</a></h3>
<p>A Communication Client is a Wallet or Asset Manager that makes use of the Tari communication network to send joining and
discovery requests. A Communication Client does not maintain the communication network and is not responsible for
forwarding or propagating any requests or data messages.</p>
<h3 id="creator-nomination-mode"><a href="#creator-nomination-mode">Creator Nomination Mode</a></h3>
<p>An asset runs in creator nomination mode when <em>every</em> validator node in a validator committee is a <a href="#trusted-node" title="A permissioned Validator Node nominated by an Asset Issuer">Trusted Node</a> that
was directly nominated by the <a href="#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">Asset Issuer</a>.</p>
<h3 id="current-head"><a href="#current-head">Current head</a></h3>
<p>The last <a href="#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a> of the base layer that represents the latest valid block. This <a href="#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a> must be from the longest
proof-of-work chain to be the current head.</p>
<h3 id="cut-through"><a href="#cut-through">Cut-Through</a></h3>
<p>Cut-through is the process where outputs spent within a single block may be removed without breaking the standard <a href="#mimblewimble">MimbleWimble</a>
validation rules. Simplistically, <code>Alice -&gt; Bob -&gt; Carol</code> may be &quot;cut-through&quot; to <code>Alice -&gt; Carol</code>. Bob's commitments may be removed.</p>
<p>On Tari, for reasons described in <a href="https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0201_TariScript.html">RFC-0201_TariScript</a>, cut-through is prevented from ever happening.</p>
<h3 id="digital-asset"><a href="#digital-asset">Digital asset</a></h3>
<p>Digital assets (DAs) are the sets or collections of native digital tokens (both fungible and non-fungible) that are
created by <a href="#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">asset issuer</a>s on the Tari 2nd layer. For example, a promoter might create a DA for a music concert event.
The event is the digital asset, and the tickets for the event are digital asset <a href="#digital-asset-tokens" title="or just, &quot;tokens&quot;. The tokens associated with a given digital asset. Tokens are created
 by asset issuers">tokens</a>.</p>
<h3 id="digital-asset-network"><a href="#digital-asset-network">Digital Asset Network</a></h3>
<p>The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed on the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN). These
interactions (defined in <a href="#instructions" title="Second-layer network commands for managing digital asset state">instruction</a>s) are processed and validated by <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">Validator Node</a>s.</p>
<h3 id="digitalassettemplate"><a href="#digitalassettemplate">DigitalAssetTemplate</a></h3>
<p>A DigitalAssetTemplate is one of a set of contract types supported by the DAN. These contracts are non-turing complete
and consist of rigid rule-sets with parameters that can be set by Asset Issuers.</p>
<h3 id="digital-asset-tokens"><a href="#digital-asset-tokens">Digital asset tokens</a></h3>
<p>Digital asset tokens (or often, just &quot;tokens&quot;) are the finite set of digital entities associated with a given digital
asset. Depending on the DA created, tokens can represent tickets, in-game items, collectibles or loyalty points. They
are bound to the <a href="#digital-asset" title="Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">digital asset</a> that created them.</p>
<h3 id="hashed-time-locked-contract"><a href="#hashed-time-locked-contract">Hashed Time Locked Contract</a></h3>

<em>h</em><sup>th</sup> block.</p>
<h3 id="instructions"><a href="#instructions">Instructions</a></h3>
<p>Instructions are the <a href="#digital-asset-network" title="The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed here.">digital asset network</a> equivalent of <a href="#transaction" title="Base layer tari coin transfers.">transaction</a>s. Instructions are issued by asset issuers and
client applications and are relayed by the DAN to the <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">validator node</a>s that are managing the associated
<a href="#digital-asset" title="Sets of Native digital tokens, both fungible and non-fungible that are created by
asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">digital asset</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mempool"><a href="#mempool">Mempool</a></h3>
<p>The mempool consists of the transaction pool, pending pool, orphan pool and reorg pool, and is responsible for managing
unconfirmed transactions that have not yet been included in the longest proof-of-work chain. Miners usually draw
verified transactions from the mempool to build up transaction <a href="#block" title="A collection of transactions and associated metadata recorded as a single entity in the Tari blockchain">block</a>s.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-signature"><a href="#metadata-signature">Metadata Signature</a></h3>
<p>The metadata signature is an aggregated Commitment Signature (&quot;ComSig&quot;) signature, attached to a transaction output and
signed with a combination of the homomorphic commitment private values \( (v_i \, , \, k_i )\), the spending key
known only to the receiver, and sender offset private key \(k_{Oi}\) known only to the sender. This prevents
malleability of the UTXO metadata.</p>
<h3 id="mimblewimble"><a href="#mimblewimble">Mimblewimble</a></h3>
<p>Mimblewimble is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency protocol. It was
<a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt">dropped</a> in the Bitcoin Developers chatroom by an

<p>Multi-signatures (Multisigs) are also known as N-of-M signatures, this means that a minimum of N number of the M peers
need to agree before a transaction can be spent. N and M can be equal; which is a special case and is often referred to
as an N-of-N Multisig.</p>

communication network">communication node</a> or <a href="#communication-client" title="A communication client that makes use of the Tari communication network,
but does not maintain it">communication client</a> in the
Tari communication network. The node ID can either be obtained from registration on the <a href="#base-layer" title="The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work">Base Layer</a> or can be derived
from the public identification key of a <a href="#communication-node" title="A communication node that is responsible for maintaining the Tari
communication network">communication node</a> or <a href="#communication-client" title="A communication client that makes use of the Tari communication network,

asset issuers on the Tari 2nd layer">digital asset</a>. It is another name for a
[digital asset token]. NFTs are contained within specially marked <a href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s on the Tari Base Layer.</p>
<h3 id="orphan-pool"><a href="#orphan-pool">Orphan Pool</a></h3>
<p>The orphan pool is part of the <a href="#mempool" title="A memory pool for unconfirmed transactions on the base layer">mempool</a> and manages all <a href="#transaction" title="Base layer tari coin transfers.">transaction</a>s that have been verified but attempt to spend

can be processed or attempts to spend <a href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>s with time-locks.</p>
<p>This is a local setting for each node to help reduce syncing time and bandwidth. This is the number of blocks from the
chain tip beyond which a chain will be pruned.</p>
<h3 id="public-nomination-mode"><a href="#public-nomination-mode">Public Nomination Mode</a></h3>
<p>An asset runs in public nomination mode when the <a href="#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">Asset Issuer</a> broadcasts a call for nominations to the network and VNs
from the network nominate themselves as candidates to become members of the <a href="#committee" title="A group of validator nodes that are responsible for managing a specific Digital Asset">committee</a> for the asset. The
<a href="#asset-issuer" title="An entity that creates digital assets on the Tari DAN">Asset Issuer</a> will then employ the <a href="#committeeselectionstrategy" title="A strategy for an Asset Issuer to select candidates for the
committee from the available registered Validator Nodes who responded to the nomination call for that asset">CommitteeSelectionStrategy</a> to select the committee from the list of available
candidates.</p>

<h3 id="registration-deposit"><a href="#registration-deposit">Registration Deposit</a></h3>
<p>An amount of tari coin that is locked up on the base layer when a <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">Validator Node</a> is registered. In order to make Sybil
attacks expensive and to provide an authorative base layer registry of <a href="#validator-node" title="A second-layer node that manages and validates digital asset state transitions">validator node</a>s they will need to lock up a
amount of <a href="#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari Coin</a> on the <a href="#base-layer" title="The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work">Base Layer</a> using a registration transaction to begin acting as a VN on the DAN.</p>
<h3 id="registration-term"><a href="#registration-term">Registration Term</a></h3>
<p>The minimum amount of time that a VN registration lasts, the <a href="#registration-deposit" title="An amount of tari coin that is locked up on the base layer when a
[Validator Node] is registered">Registration Deposit</a> can only be released after this
minimum period has elapsed.</p>
<h3 id="reorg-pool"><a href="#reorg-pool">Reorg Pool</a></h3>
<p>The reorg pool is part of the <a href="#mempool" title="A memory pool for unconfirmed transactions on the base layer">mempool</a> and stores all <a href="#transaction" title="Base layer tari coin transfers.">transaction</a>s that have recently been included in blocks in case
a blockchain reorganization occurs and the transactions need to be restored to the <a href="#transaction-pool" title="A pool in the Mempool for valid and verified unconfirmed transactions">transaction pool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="script-keypair"><a href="#script-keypair">Script Keypair</a></h3>
<p>The script private - public keypair, \((k_{Si}\),\(K_{Si})\), is used in <a href="#tariscript" title="The Tari scripting system for transactions">TariScript</a> to unlock and execute the
script associated with an output. Afterwards the execution stack must contain exactly one value that must be equal to
the script public key.</p>
<h3 id="script-offset"><a href="#script-offset">Script Offset</a></h3>
<p>The script offset provides a proof that every script public key \( K_{Si} \) and sender offset public key
\( K_{Oi} \) provided for the a transaction's inputs and outputs are correct.</p>
<h3 id="sender-offset-keypair"><a href="#sender-offset-keypair">Sender Offset Keypair</a></h3>

<h3 id="spending-key"><a href="#spending-key">Spending Key</a></h3>
<p>A private spending key is a private key that permits spending of a <a href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">UTXO</a>. It is also sometimes referred to as a
Blinding Factor, since is Tari (and Mimblewimble) outputs, the value of a UTXO is <em>blinded</em> by the spending key:</p>
<p>$$ C = v.H + k.G $$</p>
<p>The public key, \(P = k.G\) is known as the <em>public</em> spending key.</p>
<h3 id="synchronisationstate"><a href="#synchronisationstate">SynchronisationState</a></h3>
<p>The current synchronisation state of a <a href="#base-node" title="A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions
and blocks">Base Node</a>. This can either be</p>
<ul>
<li><code>starting</code> - The node has freshly started up and is still waiting for first round of chain_metadata responses from its
neighbours on which to base its next state change.</li>
<li><code>header_sync</code> - The node is in the process of synchronising headers with chosen sync peer.</li>
<li><code>horizon_sync</code> - The node is in the process of syncing blocks from the tip to its [pruning horizon]</li>
<li><code>block_sync</code> -   The node is in the process of syncing all blocks back to the genesis block</li>
<li><code>listening</code> - The node has completed its syncing strategy and will continue to listen for new blocks and monitor
its neighbours to detect if it falls behind.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="synchronisationstrategy"><a href="#synchronisationstrategy">SynchronisationStrategy</a></h3>
<p>The generalised approach for a <a href="#base-node" title="A full Tari node running on the base layer, validating and propagating Tari coin transactions

<h3 id="tariscript"><a href="#tariscript">TariScript</a></h3>
<p>Tari uses a scripting system for transactions, not unlike <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">Bitcoin's scripting system</a>,
called TariScript. It is also simple, stack-based, processed from left to right, not Turing-complete, with no loops. It
is a list of instructions linked in a non malleable way to each output, specifying its conditions of spending.</p>
<h3 id="transaction"><a href="#transaction">Transaction</a></h3>
<p>Transactions are activities recorded on the Tari <a href="#blockchain" title="The linked sequence of Tari blocks on the Tari base layer">blockchain</a> running on the <a href="#base-layer" title="The Tari layer handling payments and secured by proof of work">base layer</a>. Transactions always involve a
transfer of <a href="#tari-coin" title="The base layer token">Tari coin</a>s. A <a href="#mimblewimble">mimblewimble</a> transaction body consists of one or more blinded inputs and outputs.</p>

<h3 id="unspent-transaction-outputs"><a href="#unspent-transaction-outputs">Unspent transaction outputs</a></h3>
<p>An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a discrete number of Tari that are available to be spent. The sum of all
UTXOs represents all the Tari currently in circulation. In addition, the sum of all UTXO values equals the sum of the
<a href="#block-reward" title="The amount of Tari created in every block">block reward</a>s for all blocks up to the current block height.</p>
<p>UTXO values are hidden by their <a href="#commitment">commitment</a>s. Only the owner of the UTXO and (presumably) the creator of the UTXO
(either a <a href="#coinbase-transaction">Coinbase transaction</a> or previous spender) know the value of the UTXO.</p>
<h3 id="validator-node"><a href="#validator-node">Validator Node</a></h3>
<p>Validator nodes (VNs) make up the Tari second layer, or <a href="#digital-asset-network" title="The Tari second layer. All digital asset interactions are managed here.">Digital Asset Network</a>. VNs are responsible for creating and
