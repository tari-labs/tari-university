<p>We hope to make this a learning experience for us at TLU: as a means to grow our knowledge base and internal expertise or as a refresher. We think this will also be an excellent resource for anyone interested in the myriad disciplines required to understand blockchain technology.</p>
<p>We would like this platform to be a place of learning accessible to anyone, irrespective of their degree of expertise. Our aim is to cover a wide range of topics that are relevant to the TLU space, starting at a beginner level and extending down a path of deeper complexity.</p>
