    <h1 class="mainheading" style="color: #FFF;">Welcome to Tari Labs University (TLU)</h1>
    <p class="bigger-text">Our mission is to be the premier destination for balanced and accessible learning material for blockchain, digital currency and digital assets learning material.</p>
    <p>We hope to make this a learning experience for us at TLU: as a means to grow our knowledge base and internal expertise or as a refresher. We think this will also be an excellent resource for anyone interested in the myriad disciplines required to understand blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>We would like this platform to be a place of learning accessible to anyone, irrespective of their degree of expertise. Our aim is to cover a wide range of topics that are relevant to the TLU space, starting at a beginner level and extending down a path of deeper complexity.</p>
    <p>You are welcome to contribute to our online content by submitting a pull request or issue in GitHub. To help you get started, we've compiled a Style Guide for TLU reports. Using this Style Guide, you can help us to ensure consistency in the content and layout of TLU reports.</p>

        <p>We would like this collection of educational presentations and videos to be a collaborative affair. This extends to our presentations. We are learning along with you. Our content may not be perfect first time around, so we invite you to alert us to errors and issues or, better yet, if you know how to make a pull request, to contribute a fix, write the correction and make a pull request.</p>
        <p>As much as this learning platform is called Tari Labs University and will see input from many internal contributors and external experts, we would like you to contribute to new material, be it in the form of a suggestion of topics, varying the skill levels of presentations, or posting presentations that you may feel will benefit us as a growing community. In the words of Yoda, “Always pass on what you have learned.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If you are considering contributing content to TLU, please be aware of our guiding principles:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The topic researched should be potentially relevant to the Tari protocol; chat to us on #tari-research on IRC if you're not sure.</li>
            <li>The topic should be thoroughly researched.</li>
            <li>A critical approach should be taken (in the academic sense), with critiques and commentaries sought out and presented alongside the main topic. Remember that every white paper promises the world, so go and look for counterclaims.</li>
            <li>A recommendation/conclusion section should be included, providing a critical analysis on whether or not the technology/ proposal would be useful to the Tari protocol.</li>
            <li>The work presented should be easy to read and understand, distilling complex topics into a form that is accessible to a technical but non-expert audience. Use your own voice.</li>
          </ol>

          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>This is the basic submission process we follow within TLU. We would appreciate it if you, as an external contributor, follow the same process.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get some agreement from the community that the topic is of interest.</li>
              <li>Write up your report.</li>
              <li>Push a first draft of your report as a pull request.</li>
              <li>The community will peer-review the report, much the same as we would with a code pull request.</li>
              <li>The report is merged into the master.</li>
              <li>Receive the fame and acclaim that is due.</li>
            </ol>
