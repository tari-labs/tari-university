## Introduction
- Dash is a fork of Bitcoin with some adjustments and different incentives
- Dash uses masternodes which, a 2nd tier of the network
- They focus on innovating in the areas of privacy, transaction speed and decentralised governance
- 2MB block size with around 2.5min between blocks

---

## Origin
- Launched in January 2014 as XCoin but soon rebranded as Dark Coin
- March 2015 rebranded as Dash (Digital Cash)
- Controversy when it started as they get a lot of criticism about it not being fairly mined
- Network was open but there was an issue with the software released to the public allowing only a few miners to be able to mine
- There was also a bug in the mining software which caused 2 million coins to be instantly mined before this was patched 

---

## Incentives model
- Block rewards are not just for miners like with Bitcoin 
- 45% of rewards go to miners, 45% to masternodes and 10% to treasury
- The 10% allows for funding various dash projects, such as Dash Core (developers), Dash ATMs, Dash meet ups, or other sponsored events
- They get some criticism as the majority of the masternodes are funded by those 2 million coins that were mined instantly meaning there's a high chance most decisions are made by a few parties

---

## Governance
- Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB
- DGBB is an attempt to solve both governance and funding
- Anyone can submit a budget proposal and masternodes can vote
- 10% is paid out monthly after the results of the votes are tallied
- Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) 
- Costs 5 Dash to submit a proposal to prevent spam so a proposal owner has to believe they stand a chance of getting approved

## Masternode overview
- 1000 Dash coins as collateral and financial incentive to behave responsibly
- Provide additional functionality and governance to the network in exchange for a percentage of block rewards
- 3 main functions are to facilitate 'Private Send', 'Instant Send' and to determine how funds in the treasury are spent
- Rewards for masternodes are randomly spread out between them
- Each node has one vote and can be used on budget proposals or important technical decisions
- A set of masternodes, called a [quorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum)

## Masternodes PrivateSend
- Allows for mixing transactions (Coinjoin mechanism)
- Transaction amounts need to be specific amounts like 0.01 Dash, 0.1 Dash, 1 Dash, 10 Dash to allow for efficient mixing
- Private transactions can take more than a few hours to more than a day depending on how many times you want it to be tumbled around
- Masternodes are chosen at random so an attacker would need to own a large majority of them to break PrivateSend and at that point it would be cost suicide

---

## Masternodes InstantSend 
- Allows for much faster transactions by locking transaction inputs
- Prevents double spending while waiting to be confirmed in a block
- InstantSend inputs need to be at least six blocks old or TX will be rejected
- Multiple masternodes are self selected for each input using the mathematical distance between the hash of each input and of the set of masternode funding transactions
- Must be in majority agreement (more than 6/10) to successfully lock TX inputs

---

## Conclusion

- Dash created a lot of resources for how non-mining masternodes can perform functions in the network while still being backed by proof of work
- Consensus on technical decisions can be reached much faster
- Having launch issues with the mining might detract from their credibility in the future
- Doing any proof of stake mechanisms but not having a fairly mined token seems to give a false sense of decentralization
