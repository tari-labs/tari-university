## Summary

Fast, Safe, Pure-Rust Elliptic Curve Cryptography by Isis Lovecruft & Henry De Valence

This talk discusses the design and implementation of
[curve25519-dalek](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek), a pure-Rust implementation of operations on
the elliptic curve known as Curve25519.

They discuss the goals of the library and give a brief overview of the implementation strategy.

They also discuss features of the Rust language that allow them to achieve competitive performance without sacrificing
safety or readability, and future features that could allow them to achieve more safety and more performance.

Finally, they will discuss how the dalek library makes it easy to implement complex cryptographic primitives, such as
zero-knowledge proofs.

The content in this video is not complicated, but it is an **advanced** topic, since it dives deep into the internals of
how cryptographic operations are implemented on computers.
