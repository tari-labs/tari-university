## Summary

In [this post](https://medium.com/@cathieyun/building-on-bulletproofs-2faa58af0ba8) Cathie explains the basics of the 
Bulletproofs zero knowledge proof protocol. She then goes further to explain specific applications built on top of 
Bulletproofs, which can be used for range proofs or constraint system proofs. The constraint system proof protocol was 
used to build a confidential assets scheme called Cloak and a confidential smart contract language called ZkVM.
