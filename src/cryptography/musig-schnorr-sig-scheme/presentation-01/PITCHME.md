## Introduction 

### MuSig

@div[text-left]

MuSig is a multi-signature scheme that is novel in combining:

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

<ol>
<li>Support for key aggregation;
<li>Security in the plain public-key model.
</ol>

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

There are two versions of MuSig, that are provably secure, which 
differ based on the number of communication rounds:

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

<ol>
<li>Three-round MuSig only relies on the Discrete Logarithm (DL) assumption, on which Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) also relies
<li>Two-round MuSig instead relies on the slightly stronger One-More Discrete Logarithm (OMDL) assumption
</ol>

## Terminology Recap 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

- Let ``$ p ​$`` be a large prime number

- Let ``$ \mathbb G ​$`` denote a cyclic group of prime order ``$ p ​$`` 

- Let ``$ \mathbb Z_p $`` denote the ring of integers ``$ modulo \mspace{4mu} p $`` 

- Let a generator of  ``$ \mathbb{G} $`` be denoted by ``$ g $``. Thus, there exists a number ``$ g \in\mathbb{G}  $`` such that ``$ \mathbb{G} =  \lbrace 1, \mspace{3mu}g,  \mspace{3mu}g^2,\mspace{3mu}g^3, ..., \mspace{3mu}g^{p-1} \rbrace   $``. 

- Let ``$ \textrm{H} $`` denote the hash function. 

- Let ``$ S= \lbrace (X_1,m_1),..., (X_n,m_n) \rbrace $`` be the multi-set of all public key/message pairs of all participants, where ``$ X_1=g^{x_1} $``.  

- Let ``$ \langle S \rangle $`` denote a lexicographically encoding of the multiset of public key/message pairs in ``$ S $``. 

- Let ``$ L= \lbrace X_1=g^{x_1},...,X_n=g^{x_n} \rbrace  $`` be the multi-set of all public keys.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

- Let ``$ \langle L \rangle $`` denote a lexicographically encoding of the multiset of public keys ``$ L= \lbrace X_{1}...X_{n} \rbrace  $``.

## Recap on the Schnorr Signature Scheme 

@div[text-left]

To sign a message ``$ m $``, the signer draws a random integer ``$ r \in Z_{p} $`` and computes

@divend

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

`
$$
\begin{aligned} 
R &= g^{r} \\\\
c &= \textrm{H}(X,R,m) \\\\
s &= r+cx 
\end{aligned}
$$
`
<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

+++

@div[text-left]

The signature is the pair ``$ (R,s) $``, and its validity can be checked by verifying whether 

@divend

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

`
$$
g^{s} = RX^{c}
$$
`
<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

This scheme is referred to as the "key-prefixed" variant of the scheme, which sees the public key hashed together with ``$ R ​$`` and ``$ m ​$``. 

---

## Design of the Schnorr Multi-Signature Scheme 

@div[text-left]

A group of ``$ n $`` signers want to cosign a message ``$ m $``. 
Each cosigner randomly generates and communicates to others a share 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@divend

`
$$
R_i = g^{r_{i}}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Each of the cosigners then computes:  

`
$$
R = \prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i} \mspace{30mu} \mathrm{and} \mspace{30mu} c = \textrm{H} (\tilde{X},R,m)
$$
`
where 

`
$$
\tilde{X} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}X_i 
$$
`

is the product of individual public keys 

+++

and a partial signature is then given by

`
$$
s_{i} = r_{i}+cx_{i}
$$
`

All partial signatures are then combined into a single signature ``$(R,s)​$`` where 

`
$$
s = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_i \mod p ​
$$
`

@div[text-left]

The validity of a signature ``$ (R,s) $`` on message ``$ m $`` for public keys ``$  \lbrace X_{1},...X_{n} \rbrace $`` is equivalent to 

@divend

`
$$
g^{s} = R\tilde{X}^{c}
$$
`

where ``$$ \tilde{X} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i} \mspace{30mu} \mathrm{and} \mspace{30mu}  c = \textrm{H}(\tilde{X},R,m) $$``

+++

@div[text-left]

Note that this is exactly the verification equation for a traditional key-prefixed Schnorr signature with respect to public key ``$ \tilde{X} $``, a property termed *key aggregation*. 

@divend

@div[text-left]

However, these protocols are vulnerable to a rogue-key attack where a corrupted signer sets its public key to 

@divend


`
$$
X_{1}=g^{x_{1}} (\prod_{i=2}^{n}X_{i})^{-1} 
$$
`

@div[text-left]

allowing the signer to produce signatures for public keys ``$ \lbrace X_{1},...X_{n} \rbrace ​$`` by themselves. 

@divend

---

### Bellare and Neven Signature Scheme

@div[text-left]

A group of ``$ n $`` signers want to cosign a message ``$ m $``. Their main idea is to have each cosigner use a distinct "challenge" when computing their partial signature 

`
$$
s_{i} = r_{i}+c_{i}x_{i} 
$$
`

defined as 

`
$$
c_{i} = \textrm{H}( \langle L \rangle , X_{i},R,m) 
$$
`

where 

`
$$
R = \prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}
$$
`

The equation to verify signature ``$ (R,s) $`` on message ``$ m $`` for the public keys ``$ L $`` is 

`
$$
g^s = R\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{c_{i}}
$$
`
@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

A preliminary round is also added to the signature protocol, where each signer commits to its share ``$ R_i $`` by sending ``$ t_i = \textrm{H}^\prime(R_i) $`` to other cosigners first. 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

This stops any cosigner from setting ``$ R = \prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i} $`` to some maliciously chosen value.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Bellare and Neven showed that this yields a multi-signature scheme provably secure in the *plain public-key* model under the Discrete Logarithm assumptions. However, this scheme does not allow key aggregation since the entire list of public keys is required for verification.

@divend

---

## MuSig Scheme 

@div[text-left]

MuSig is paramaterised by group parameters `$(\mathbb{G\mathrm{,p,g)}}$` and three hash functions `$ ( \textrm{H}_{com}  ,  \textrm{H}_{agg} , \textrm{H}_{sig} ) $`.

@divend


### Round 1

@div[text-left]

A group of ``$ n $`` signers want to cosign a message ``$ m $``. Let ``$ X_1 $`` and ``$ x_1 $`` be the public and private key of a specific signer, let ``$ X_2 , . . . , X_n $`` be the public keys of other cosigners and let ``$ \langle L \rangle $`` be the multiset of all public keys involved in the signing process.

@divend

@divend

For ``$ i\in  \lbrace 1,...,n \rbrace  ​$`` , the signer computes the following

`
$$
a_{i} = \textrm{H}_{agg}(\langle L \rangle,X_{i})
$$
`

as well as the "aggregated" public key 

`
$$
\tilde{X} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{a_{i}} ​
$$
`

---

### Round 2 

@div[text-left]

The signer generates a random ``$ r_{1}\leftarrow\mathbb{Z_{\mathrm{p}}} $``, computes ``$ R_{1} = g^{r_{1}} $`` and ``$ t_{1} = \textrm{H}_{com}(R_{1}) $`` and sends commitment `$t_{1}$` to all other cosigners.

@divend

@div[text-left]

When receiving the commitments ``$t_{2},...,t_{n} $`` from the other cosigners, the signer sends ``$ R_{1} $`` to all other cosigners.

@divend

@div[text-left]

Upon receiving ``$ R_2,...,R_n $`` from other cosigners, the signer verifies that ``$ t_{i}=\textrm{H}_{com}(R_{i})$`` for all ``$ i\in  \lbrace 2,...,n \rbrace $``

@divend

@div[text-left]

The protocol is aborted if this is not the case. 

@divend

---

### Round 3

@div[text-left]

If all commitment and random challenge pairs can be verified with ``$ \textrm{H}_{com} $``, the following is computed:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned} 
R &= \prod_{i=1}^{n}R_i \\\\
c &= \textrm{H}_{sig} (\tilde{X},R,m) \\\\
s_1 &= r_1 + ca_1 x_1 \mod p
\end{aligned}
$$
`


Signature ``$ s_{1} $`` is sent to all other cosigners.
When receiving ``$ s_{2},...s_{n} $`` from other cosigners, the signer can compute ``$ s = \sum_{i=1}^{n}s_{i} \mod p $``. The signature is ``$ \sigma = (R,s) $``.

+++

@div[text-left]

In order to verify the aggregated signature ``$ \sigma = (R,s) $``, given a lexicographically encoded multiset of public keys ``$ \langle L \rangle ​$`` and message ``$ m $``, the verifier computes:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned} 
a_{i} &= \textrm{H}_{agg}(\langle L \rangle,X_{i}) \mspace{9mu} \textrm {for} \mspace{9mu}  i \in  \lbrace 1,...,n \rbrace  \\\\
\tilde{X} &= \prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{a_{i}} \\\\
c &=  \textrm{H}_{sig} (\tilde{X},R,m) 
\end{aligned}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

then accepts the signature if 

@divend

`
$$
g^{s} = R\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{a_{i}c}=R\tilde{X^{c}.}
$$
`
@divend

---

## Revisions 

@div[text-left]

In a previous version of the paper by Maxwell published on 15 January 2018 they proposed a 2-round variant of MuSig, where the initial commitment round is omitted claiming a security proof under the One More Discrete Logarithm (OMDL) assumptions. Drijvers then discovered a flaw in the security proof and showed that through a meta-reduction the initial multi-signature scheme cannot be proved secure using an algebraic black box reduction under the OMDL assumption.

@divend

@div[text-left]

In more details, it was observed that in the 2-round variant of MuSig, an adversary (controlling public keys ``$ X_{2},...,X_{n} $``) can impose the value of ``$ R=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}R_{i} $`` used in signature protocols since he can choose ``$ R_{2},...,R_{n} $`` after having received ``$ R_{1} $`` from the honest signer (controlling public key ``$ X_{1}=g^{x_{1}} $`` ). This prevents one to use the initial method of simulating the honest signer in the Random Oracle model without knowing ``$ x_{1} $`` by randomly drawing ``$ s_{1} $`` and ``$ c $``, computing ``$ R_1=g^{s_1}(X_1)^{-a_1c} $``, and later programming ``$ \textrm{H}_{sig}(\tilde{X}, R, m) \mspace{2mu} : = c_1 $`` since the adversary might have made the random oracle query ``$ \textrm{H}_{sig}(\tilde{X}, R, m) $`` *before*  engaging the corresponding signature protocol.  

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Despite this, there is no attack currently known against the 2-round variant of MuSig and that it might be secure, although this is not provable under standard assumptions from existing techniques.&nbsp;

## Turning BN's Scheme into a Secure IAS 

@div[text-left]

In order to change the BN multi-signature scheme into an IAS scheme, Maxwell proposed the scheme described below, which includes a fix to make the execution of the signing algorithm dependent on the message index. 

If ``$ X = g^{x_i} $`` is the public key of a specific signer and ``$ m $`` the message he wants to sign, and 

@divend

`
$$
S^\prime =  \lbrace (X^\prime_1, m^\prime_1),..., (X^\prime_{n-1}, m^\prime_{n-1}) \rbrace 
$$
`

@div[text-left]

is the set of the public key/message pairs of other signers, this specific signer merges ``$ (X, m) $`` and ``$ S^\prime $`` into the ordered set 

@divend

`
$$
\langle S \rangle \mspace{6mu} \mathrm{of} \mspace{6mu}  S =  \lbrace (X_{1}, m_{1}),..., (X_{n}, m_{n}) \rbrace 
$$
`

@div[text-left]

and retrieves the resulting message index ``$ i ​$`` such that 

@divend

`
$$
(X_{1}, m_{i}) = (X, m)
$$
`
@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Each signer then draws ``$ r_{1}\leftarrow\mathbb{Z_{\mathrm{p}}} $``, computes ``$  R_{i} = g^{r_{i}} $`` and subsequently sends commitment ``$  t_{i} = H^\prime(R_{i}) ​$`` in a first round and then ``$ R_{i} $`` in a second round, and then computes  

@divend

`
$$
R = \prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}
$$
`
@div[text-left]

The signer with message index ``$ i ​$`` then computes:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned} 
c_{i} &= H(R, \langle S \rangle, i)\\\\
s_{i} &= r_{i} + c_{i}x_{i} \mod p
\end{aligned} 
$$
`

@div[text-left]

and then sends ``$ s_i $`` to other signers. All signers can compute 

@divend

`
$$
s = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}s_{i} \mod p
$$
`

+++

@div[text-left]

The signature is ``$ \sigma = (R, s) ​$``. 

Given an ordered set ``$ \langle S \rangle \mspace{6mu} \mathrm{of} \mspace{6mu} S =  \lbrace (X_{1}, m_{1}),...,(X_{n}, m_{n}) \rbrace  $`` and a signature ``$ \sigma = (R, s) $``  then ``$ \sigma $`` is valid for ``$ S ​$`` when 

@divend

`
$$
g^s = R\prod_{i=1}^{n}X_{i} ^{H(R, \langle S \rangle, i)}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

**Note:** As of writing of this, the secure IAS scheme presented here still needs to undergo a complete security analysis.

@divend

---

## Conclusions, Observations and Recommendations

@div[text-left]

<ul>
<li>MuSig leads to both native and private multi-signature transactions with signature aggregation
<li>Signature data for multi-signatures can be large and cumbersome. MuSig will allow users to create more complex transactions without burdening the network and revealing compromising information.
<li>The IAS case where each signer signs their own message must still be proven by a complete security analysis.
</ul>
