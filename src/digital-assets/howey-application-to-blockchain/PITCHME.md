## Recent Events

- Illegal token offerings and sales (as determined by the SEC):
  - Munchee
  - Airfox
  - Paragon
  - Gladius

- Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets

- June 14, 2018 Speech by William Hinman, Director of SEC's Division of Corporation Finance

## What is a Security?

- Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act
- Investment Contract

---

## What is an Investment Contract (i.e. Howey Test)?

- SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.
- Howey provides that an investment contract exists if there is:
  - an investment of money;
  - into a common enterprise;
  - with a reasonable expectation of profits;
  - derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.
- For an instrument to be an investment contract, each element of the Howey test must be met.

---

## Fourth Prong of Howey Test - Efforts of Others

- Relevant for public blockchain networks
  - Decentralization of control
  - Does the kind and degree of decentralization that exists mean that any expectation of profits token purchasers may have does not come from the efforts of others for purposes of Howey?

## Decentralization, Consumptive Purpose and Priming Purchasers' Expectations

- Hinman: Two cases where "a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering can ever later be sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security":
  - "[W]here there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in" (e.g. decentralized enterprise or network); and
  - "[W]here the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created" (e.g. purchases for a consumptive purpose)
- Hinman: Noted questions to consider when seeking to determine "whether a third party - be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors - drives the expectation of a return" (e.g. priming purchasers' expectations)
- Framework: Similarly focuses attention on whether a purchaser of a digital asset has a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others

## Decentralization

- Degree and nature of a promoter's involvement has a bearing on the Howey analysis
  -  If a promoter does not play a significant role in the "development, improvement (or enhancement), operation, or promotion of the network" underlying the tokens, it cuts against finding the "efforts of others" prong has been met
    - Direct efforts to impact a token's supply and/or demand (e.g. buying and selling)
    - Indirect efforts (e.g. creating ecosystem)
  - If the value of a token is driven by market forces, it suggests its value is attributable to factors other than the promoter's efforts
  - "Essential tasks and responsibilities" widely dispersed
- Does it make sense to apply U.S. federal securities laws to a particular token offering or sale?
  - Who should be subject to the disclosure obligations?
  - What information is expected to be disclosed?

---

## Consumptive Purpose

- Token purchasers who plan to use their tokens to access a network's functionality typically are not speculating that the tokens will increase in value
- Offering tokens to potential purchasers in a manner inconsistent with a consumptive purpose can serve to foster non-consumptive intent
  - Promoter may seek to limit the offering and sale of tokens to prospective network users
  - Promoter may also seek to ensure content of and audience for marketing other communication related to the token offering  is consistent with consumption being the reason for purchasing tokens
  - Promoters may also consider whether restrictions on transferability of the token are consistent with its use and not facilitating a speculative market
- Argument that purchasers are acquiring tokens for consumption will be stronger once the network is functional and tokens can actually be used to purchase goods or access services through the network

---

## Priming Purchasers' Expectations

- Were token purchasers led to expect that the promoter would make efforts to increase token value?
  - SEC has highlighted promoter statements made that specifically tout the opportunity to profit from purchasing a token
  - Promotional statements relating to tokens being listed on digital asset exchanges for secondary trading also draw attention
  - Framework: Purchasers may have an expectation that the promoter will undertake efforts to promote its own interests and enhance the value of the network or digital assets.  Promotional statements that create such an expectation have also been a focus of attention

---

## Conclusion

- Various SEC actions and statements offer guidance as to whether a particular token is a security under the Act.
- Analysis hinges on the application of the Howey test to determine if the token is an "investment contract" under the Act, and therefore a security.
- Decentralization of control many public blockchain projects seek to foster places Howey's "efforts of others" prong as a key area of focus. Questions regarding the application of this prong generally relate to:
  - Decentralization of the enterprise underlying the tokens;
  - Consumptive purpose of token purchasers; and
  - Whether token purchasers were led to have an expectation that the promoter would take efforts to drive token value.
- Indicative of the SEC's approach to evaluating the offer and sale of digital assets.
