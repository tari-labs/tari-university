## Confidential Assets

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

*Confidential assets have value, can be owned (right to use), has no physical presence (intangible), stored in digital form/online account. The confidentiality aspect implies that the amount of assets owned & the asset type transacted in can be confidential.*

## Confidential Asset Properties

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

Confidential assets propose a scheme where multiple non-interchangeable asset types can be supported within a single transaction within one blockchain.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

It offers private base layer atomic asset trades: Alice pay Bob $ 100 ​$ of asset type $ A ​$ for $ 50 ​$ of asset type $ B ​$ in a single transaction, both participants using a single wallet.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

No relationship between output asset types can be established or inferred by not having multiple single-asset transactions.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Confidential assets prohibit censorship of transactions involving specific asset types, and keeps low volume asset transactions private where users could be identified very easily.

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Assets can be issued; associating a maximum of one issuance with the spending of a specific UTXO ensures uniqueness (prevent inflation). 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Assets can also be re-issued (increased or decreased) if asset reissuance token is generated together with the initial asset issuance.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

The asset type to pay fees must be revealed in each transaction, but all fees could be paid in only one asset type, thus preserving privacy. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Payment authorization is achieved by means of input signatures.

## Preliminaries

<div class="LineHeight20per"> </div>

@div[text-left]

<u>General Notation</u>

@divend

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

- Let $ p $ be a large prime number
- Let $ \mathbb G $ denote a cyclic group of prime order $ p $ 
- Let $ \mathbb Z_p $ denote the ring of integers $ modulo \mspace{4mu} p $ 
- Let $ \mathbb F_p $ be a group of elliptic curve points over a finite (prime) field
- If not otherwise specified, lower case $ x,r,y $ etc. are ordinary numbers (integers), upper case $ H,G $ are curve points

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

<u>Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP):</u> The discrete logarithm $ \log_ba = k $ such that $ b^k=a $ for any integer $ k $ where $ a,b \in \mathbb G $ is hard to guess (has no efficient solution) for carefully chosen $ \mathbb F_p $. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

<u>Surjection Function:</u> A surjection function simply means that for every element $ y $ in the codomain $ Y $ of function $ f $ there is at least one element $ x $ in the domain $ X $ of function $ f $ such that $ f(x) = y$. 

@divend

---

## Confidential Transactions Overview

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

<u>Confidential transactions</u> made confidential by replacing each UTXO with a homomorphic commitment (e.g. Pedersen Commitment), and made robust against overflow and inflation attacks by using efficient Zero-knowledge (ZK) range proofs (e.g. Bulletproofs).

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

<u>Range proofs</u> provide proof that secret committed value lies in certain interval, prevents numbers coming near magnitude of large prime, say $ 2^{256} $, that can cause wrap around when adding a small number, e.g. proof that a number $ x \in [0,2^{64} - 1] $.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

<u>Pedersen Commitments (PC)</u> are perfectly hiding (an attacker with infinite computing power cannot tell what amount has been committed to) and computationally binding (no efficient algorithm running in a practical amount of time can produce fake commitments except with small probability).

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

<u>Elliptic Curve (EC) PC</u> to value $ x \in \mathbb Z_p $ with $ r \in \mathbb Z_p $ a random blinding factor is

`
$$
C(x,r) = xH + rG
$$
`

Here $ G \in \mathbb F_p $ is a random generator point and $ H \in \mathbb F_p $ specially chosen so that $ x_H $ satisfying $ H = x_H G $ cannot be found except if the EC DLP is solved. In secp256k1 $ H $ is the SHA256 hash of simple encoded $ x $-coordinate of generator point $ G $. The number $ H $ is what is known as a Nothing Up My Sleeve (NUMS) number. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

A <u>PC implementation</u> uses three algorithms: **<code>Setup()</code>** to set up the commitment parameters $ G $ and $ H $; **<code>Commit()</code>** to commit to the message $ x $ using the commitment parameters $ r $, $ H $ and $ G $ and **<code>Open()</code>** to open and verify the commitment.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Mimblewimble use these confidential transaction primitives, but <u>if confidentiality is not sought</u>, the homomorphic commitment to the given amount will have a blinding factor $ r = 0 $.

@divend

---

## Asset Commitments and Surjection Proofs

@div[text-left]

Confidential assets must be confidential and proven to not be inflationary; this is made possible by using asset commitments and Asset Surjection Proofs (ASP).

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Given unique asset description $ A ​$ the associated asset tag $ H_A \in \mathbb G ​$ is calculated using the PC function <code>Setup()</code> with $ A ​$ as auxiliary input. (*Selection of $ A ​$ is discussed later.*) Consider a transaction with 2 inputs & 2 outputs involving 2 asset types $ A ​$ and $ B ​$ 

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
in_A = x_1H_A + r_{A_1}G \\
out_A = x_2H_A + r_{A_2}G \\
in_B = y_1H_B + r_{B_1}G \\
out_B = y_2H_B + r_{B_2}G
\end{aligned}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

For this to hold the sum of the outputs minus the sum of the inputs must be zero:

@divend



+++

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
(out_A + out_B) - (in_A + in_B) &= 0 \\
(x_2H_A + r_{A_2}G) + (y_2H_B + r_{B_2}G) - (x_1H_A + r_{A_1}G) - (y_1H_B + r_{B_1}G) &= 0 \\
(r_{A_2} + r_{B_2} - r_{A_1} - r_{B_1})G + (x_2 - x_1)H_A + (y_2 - y_1)H_B &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

Since $ H_A $ and $ H_B $ are both NUMS asset tags, total input and output amounts of assets $ A $ and $ B $ must be equal respectively. However, asset types are publicly visible, thus not confidential. Let's replace each asset tag with blinded version of itself, thus asset commitment to asset tag $ H_A $ (blinded asset tag) is then

@divend

`
$$
H_{0_A} = H_A + rG
$$
`

@div[text-left]

Thus, such a PC commits to the committed amount as well as to the underlying asset tag.

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

A commitment to the value `$ x_1 $` using blinded asset tag `$ H_{0_A} $` is also a commitment to `$ x_1 $` using the asset tag `$ H_A $` as seen below:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
C(x_1, r_{A_1}) &= x_1H_{0_A} + r_{A_1}G \\
&= x_1(H_A + rG) + r_{A_1}G \\
&= x_1H_A + (r_{A_1} + x_1r)G \\
&= C(x_1, r_{A_1} + x_1r)
\end{aligned}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

Correspondingly, the zero sum rule translates to:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
(out_A + out_B) - (in_A + in_B) &= 0 \\
(x_2H_{0_A} + r_{A_2}G) + (y_2H_{0_B} + r_{B_2}G) - (x_1H_{0_A} + r_{A_1}G) - (y_1H_{0_B} + r_{B_1}G) &= 0 \\
(r_{A_2} + r_{B_2} - r_{A_1} - r_{B_1})G + (x_2 - x_1)H_{0_A} + (y_2 - y_1)H_{0_B} &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
`

+++

@div[text-left]

However, using only the sum to zero rule it is still possible to introduce negative amounts of an asset type. Consider blinded asset tag

@divend

`
$$
H_{0_A} = -H_A + rG
$$
`

@div[text-left]

Any amount of blinded asset tag `$ H_{0_A} $` will correspond a negative amount of asset $ A $, thereby inflating its supply. Thus, the ASP is introduced.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

An ASP scheme provides a proof $ \pi $ for a set of "*input*" asset commitments `$ [ H_i ] ^n_{i=1} $`, an "*output*" asset commitment `$ H = H_{\hat i} + rG $` for $ \hat i = 1 \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} . . . \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} n $ and blinding factor $ r $.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

It proofs that every output asset type is the same as some input asset type while blinding which outputs correspond to which inputs. Such a proof $ \pi $ is secure if it is a ZK proof of knowledge for the blinding factor $ r $. 

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]


Let `$ H_{0_{A1}} $` and `$ H_{0_{A2}} $` be blinded asset tags that commit to the same asset tag `$ H_A $`:

@divend

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0_{A1}} &= H_A + r_1G \\
H_{0_{A2}} &= H_A + r_2G
\end{aligned}
$$
`

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

Taking the difference we have

@divend

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{difference}_{H_{0}} &= H_{0_{A1}} - H_{0_{A2}} \\
&= (H_A + r_1G) - (H_A + r_2G) \\
&= (r_1 - r_2)G
\end{aligned}
$$
`

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

This is a signature key with secret key $ r_1 - r_2 ​$. 

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Thus for an $ n ​$ distinct multiple asset type transaction, differences can be calculated between each output and all inputs:

@divend

`
$$
\begin{aligned}
(out_A - in_A) \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} (out_A - in_B)  \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} . . . \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu}  &(out_A - in_n) \\
(out_B - in_A) \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} (out_B - in_B)  \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} . . . \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu}  &(out_B - in_n) \\
. \\
. \\
(out_n - in_A) \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} (out_n - in_B)  \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} . . . \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu}  &(out_n - in_n)
\end{aligned}
$$
`

@div[text-left]

This has the form of a ring signature. If $ out_A  $ has the same asset tag as one of the inputs, the transaction signer will know the secret key corresponding to one of these differences, and able to produce the ring signature. 

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

The ASP is based on the *Back-Maxwell* range proof, a variation of *Borromean* ring signatures, in turn a variant of the *Abe-Ohkubo-Suzuki* (AOS) ring signature.  An AOS ASP computes a ring signature that is equal to the proof $ \pi $ as follows:

@divend

<div class="LineHeight200per"> <br></div>

- Calculate $ n $ differences $ H - H_{\hat i } $ for $ \hat i = 1 \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} . . . \mspace{3mu} , \mspace{3mu} n $ one of which will be equal to the blinding factor $ r $;
- Calculate a ring signature $ S ​$ of an empty message using the $ n ​$ differences. 

<div class="LineHeight200per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

The resulting ring signature $ S ​$ is equal to the proof $ \pi ​$, and the ASP consist of this ring signature $ S ​$.

@divend

---

## Asset Transactions

@div[text-left]

Assets originate in asset-issuance inputs, which take the place of coinbase transactions in confidential transactions. A confidential asset transaction consists of the following data:

@divend

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

- A list of inputs, each having one of the following forms:
  - Reference to an output of another transaction, with a signature using that output's verification key, or;
  - An asset issuance input, which has an explicit amount and asset tag.
- A list of outputs that contains:
  - A signature verification key;
  - An asset commitment $ H_0 $ with an ASP from all input asset commitments to $ H_0 $;
  - PC to an amount using generator $ H_0 $ in place of $ H $, with associated *Back-Maxwell* range proof.
- A fee `$ \{ (f_i , H_i) \}_{i=1}^n $`, where `$ f_i $` is a non-negative scalar amount denominated in the asset with tag `$ H_i $`. 

+++

@div[text-left]

Every output has a range proof and ASP associated with it, which are proofs of knowledge of the PC opening information and asset commitment blinding factor. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

Every range proof can be considered as being with respect to the <u>underlying asset tag</u> $ H_A ​$, rather than the asset commitment $ H_0 ​$. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

The confidential transaction is restricted to only inputs and outputs with asset tag $ H_A ​$, except that output commitments minus input commitments minus fee sum to a <u>commitment to</u> $ 0 ​$ instead of to the point $ 0 ​$ itself.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

However, confidential assets come at an additional data cost. For a transaction with $ m ​$ outputs and $ n ​$ inputs, in relation to the units of space used for confidential transactions, the asset commitment has size $ 1​$, the ASP has size $ n + 1 ​$ and the entire transaction therefor has size $ m(n + 2) ​$.

@divend

---

## Asset Issuance, Reissuance

@div[text-left]

Any auxiliary input used to create an asset tag may only be used once to prevent inflation. Given asset entropy $ E $, auxiliary input $ A $ for asset issuance defined as 

@divend

`
$$
A = \mathrm {Hash} ( E \parallel 0)
$$
`

@div[text-left]

resulting in asset tag `$ H_A \in \mathbb G $`.  Auxiliary input $ \hat A $ for asset reissuance for the same asset entropy $ E $ defined as 

@divend

`
$$
\hat A = \mathrm {Hash} ( E \parallel 1)
$$
`

@div[text-left]

resulting in asset tag `$ H_{\hat A} \in \mathbb G $`.  Poelstra et al. suggested use of a Ricardian contract to be hashed together with the reference to the UTXO being spent, but any unique NUMS value will do. Let $I ​$ be the input being spent, let $ \widehat {RC} ​$ be the issuer-specified Ricardian contract, then asset entropy $ E ​$ is defined as 

@divend

`
$$
E = \mathrm {Hash} ( \mathrm {Hash} (I) \parallel \mathrm {Hash} (\widehat {RC}))
$$
`

@div[text-left]

Every non-coinbase transaction input thus limited to one new asset issuance.

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Asset reissuance token(s) must be generated together with initial asset issuance. The asset owner can reveal the blinding factor $ r $ for the reissuance capability along with the original asset entropy $ E $. 

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

@divend

@div[left-50 text-left]

<u>Asset issuance transaction input:</u>

<ul>
<li>UTXO $I $ being spent
<li>Ricardian contract $ \widehat {RC} $ (*or similar NUMS*)
<li>Initial issuance explicit value or a Pedersen commitment
<li>Range proof
<li>Boolean field indicating whether reissuance is allowed
</ul>


@divend

@div[right-50 text-left]

<u>Asset reissuance transaction input:</u>

<ul>
<li>Spend of a UTXO containing an asset reissuance capability
<li>Original asset entropy
<li>Blinding factor for the asset commitment of the UTXO being spent
<li>Explicit reissuance amount or Pedersen commitment
<li>Range proof
</ul>
@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Poelstra et al. suggests more efficient range proofs, ASPs and use of aggregate range proofs. The scheme could also be adapted for optimal tradeoff between ASP data size and privacy by introducing a global dynamic list of assets, whereby each transaction selects a subset of asset tags for the corresponding ASPs.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

The Back-Maxwell range proof scheme used for development of this scheme were based on the Back-Maxwell range proof scheme. It is thus an open question if Bulletproofs could fulfill this requirement.

<div class="LineHeight100per"> <br></div>

If all asset tags are defined at the instantiation of the blockchain it will be compatible with the [Mimblewimble](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-1/sources/PITCHME.link.html) protocol. 

@divend

## Implementations

<div class="LineHeight100per"> </div>

  - Elements Project
  - Chain Core Confidential Assets
  - Cloak

+++

### Elements Project

- [Elements](https://elementsproject.org) is an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform, providing access to advanced features, such as Confidential Transactions and Issued Assets.
- The Elements project hosts a working demonstration of confidential asset transfers (`Github: ElementsProject/confidential-assets-demo`) involving 5 parties.

![Ricardian Contract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/master/src/digital-assets/confidential-assets/sources/elements-tx-example.png)

@divend

+++


### Chain Core Confidential Assets

- Chain Core is a shared, multi-asset, cryptographic ledger, designed for enterprise financial infrastructure. It supports the coexistence and interoperability of multiple types of assets on the same network in their Confidential Assets framework.
- Chain Core is based on Elements, and available as an open source project, but has been archived. It has been succeeded by Sequence, a ledger-as-a-service project.
- Chain Core implements all native features of Elements. They were also working towards implementing ElGamal commitments into Chain Core to make their Confidential Assets framework quantum secure, but it is unclear if this effort was concluded at the time the project was archived.

+++


### Cloak

- Chain/Interstellar introduced Cloak, a redesign of Chain Core's Confidential Assets framework to make use of Bulletproof range proofs.
- Cloak is all about confidential asset transactions, called cloaked transactions, which exchange values of different asset types, called flavors.
- The protocol ensures that values are not transmuted to any other asset types, that quantities do not overflow and that both quantities and asset types are kept secret. 
- A traditional Bulletproofs implementation convert an arithmetic circuit into a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS); Cloak bypasses arithmetic circuits and provide an API for building a [constraint system](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.html#evolving-bulletproof-protocols) directly. 
- The R1CS API consists of a hierarchy of task-specific “gadgets”, used by the *Prover* and *Verifier* to allocate variables and define constraints.
- The Cloak development is still ongoing.

## Ricardian Contracts vs. Smart Contracts

@div[text-left]

“*<u>Ricardian Contract:</u> A digital contract that deﬁnes the terms and conditions of an interaction, between two or more peers, that is cryptographically signed and veriﬁed, being both human and machine readable and digitally signed.*”

<div class="LineHeight100per"> </div>

Ricardian contracts are robust (due to identification by cryptographic hash functions), transparent (due to readable text for legal prose) and efficient (due to computer markup language to extract essential information).

<div class="LineHeight100per"> </div>

“*<u>Smart Contract</u>: A computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract. The general objectives are to satisfy common contractual conditions.*”

<div class="LineHeight100per"> </div>

With smart contracts, digital assets can be exchanged in a transparent and non-conflicting way; it provides trust.

## Conclusions

- Ricardian contract in the asset tag creation warrants more investigation for a new confidential blockchain protocol like Tari; Ricardian contracts could be used in asset generation in the probable 2nd layer.
- Asset commitments and ASPs are important cryptographic primitives for confidential asset transactions.
- The Elements project implemented a range of useful confidential asset framework features and should be critically assessed for usability in a probable Tari 2nd layer.
- Cloak has the potential to take confidential assets implementation to the next level in efficiency and should be closely monitored. Interstellar is in the process to fully implement and extend Bulletproofs for use in confidential assets.
- If confidential assets are to be implemented in a Mimblewimble blockchain, all asset tags must be defined at its instantiation, otherwise it will not be compatible.
