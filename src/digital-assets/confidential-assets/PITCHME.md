## Confidential Assets

<br>

@div[text-left]

*Confidential assets have value, can be owned (right to use), has no physical presence (intangible), stored in digital form/online account. The confidentiality aspect implies that the amount of assets owned & the asset type transacted in can be confidential.*

## Preliminaries

Mathematics ????

General notation

- $ p â€‹$ will be a large prime number
- $ \mathbb G $ will denote a cyclic group of prime order $ p $ 
- $ \mathbb Z_p $ will denote the ring of integers $ modulo \mspace{4mu} p $ 
- $ \mathbb F_p $ will be a group of elliptic curve points over a finite (prime) field
- Elliptic curve arithmetic: lower case letters -> ordinary numbers (integers), upper case letters -> curve points

<u>DLP:</u> Powers $ b^k \in \mathbb G $ can be defined for all integers $ k \in \mathbb G $, and the discrete logarithm $ \log_ba = k $ such that $ b^k=a $ is hard to guess for carefully chosen $  \mathbb F_p $.

## Confidential Transactions Overview

EC Pedersen Commitment to value $ x \in \mathbb Z_p $ has the following form $ C(x,r) = xH + rG $

Confidential transactions -> replace each UTXO with a homomorphic commitment (i.e. Pedersen Commitment), and made robust against overflow and inflation attacks by using efficient ZK range proofs (i.e. Bulletproofs)
