# Scaling

## Purpose

"Layer 2 scaling solutions are designed with the goal of always leaving a cryptographic trail of evidence for all 
participants involved" [[1]].

## Definitions

- From [<u>**Tari Labs**</u>](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/blob/master/src/layer2scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/layer2scaling-survey.md): 
Analogous to the OSI layers for communication, in block chain technology decentralized Layer 2 protocols, also commonly 
referred to as Layer 2 scaling, refers to transaction throughput scaling solutions. Decentralized Layer 2 protocols run 
on top of the main block chain (off-chain), while preserving the attributes of the main block chain (e.g. crypto economic 
consensus). Instead of each transaction, only the resultant of a number of transactions are embedded on-chain [[2]].

- From [<u>**CryptoDigest**</u>](https://cryptodigestnews.com/the-logic-of-layer-2-scaling-fe51a8879e13): Layer 2 scaling 
solutions utilize an interesting approach to scale blockchains while keeping them decentralized. Layer 2 solutions are 
protocols built “on top” of blockchains and sacrifice some security in order to potentially match VISA transaction 
levels. Layer 2 solutions are built with the intention of keeping the user in control at all times [[1]].
