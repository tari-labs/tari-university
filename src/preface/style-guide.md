Minimal layout and content standard for Tari Labs University (TLU) reports.

Use the US spelling standard. Reference: Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, latest edition.???

If it is necessary to use abbreviations in a report, write the abbreviation out in full at its first occurrence in the text, followed by the abbreviation in brackets (e.g. Tari Labs University (TLU), graphical user interface (GUI). Thereafter, use the abbreviation only.

Use ISO standards (ISO 1000:1992) for expressing units of measure (e.g. W = Watt, min = minute, s = second, h = hour, 
g = gram). These are internationally agreed abbreviations.

Abbreviations of units should be consistent and not changed in the plural. For example, 1 cm and not 10 cms; 5 min and not 5 mins.

Leave a space between numbers and units of measure (e.g. 75 kg, 15 s, 120 Â°C (but 100Â°, 25%).

Use a 'non-breaking space' (nbsp) to prevent numbers and units from being split over two lines.

For example:

Incorrect: The dimensions of the objects are: 2 m x 2 m x 1 m; 3 m x 2 m x 1 m; 1 m x 1 m x 50 mm; 4 m x 2 m x 1 m; 1 
m x 2 m x 3 m.

Correct: The dimensions of the objects are: 2 m x 2 m x 1 m; 3 m x 2 m x 1 m; 1 m x 1 m x 50 mm; 4 m x 2 m x 1 m; 
1 m x 2 m x 3 m.

Indicate clearly to which unit a number belongs:

Incorrect: 11 x 11 x 11 mm

Correct: 11 mm x 11 mm x 11 mm

Use 'to' rather than a dash to indicate a range of values:

Incorrect: 1 - 10 cm

Correct: 1 cm to 10 cm

Use a space to indicate thousands (1 000, 20 000 000, 250 000).

Leave a space on either side of signs such as + (plus), - (minus), = (equal to), > (greater than) and < (less than).

Date format: yyyy-mm-dd (year-month-date).

Date when written in text: 'The document was submitted for approval on 10 March 2019'.

Time: use the international format - 11:00; 15:00.

Use the decimal point and not the decimal comma.

Write out numbers from one to nine in full in text; use Arabic numerals for 10 onwards.

Use only one space after words, commas, full stops, colons, and semi-colons.

Use single quotation marks for a first quotation. Use double quotation marks for a quotation within a quotation.

Be specific when referring to text, figures, tables, and references. Avoid using 'below' or 'above'. Rather give a specific paragraph, figure, table or reference number.

Structure

Every section in a Tari report starts with a bulleted list of all the headings in that section, for quick reference and consistency. For example, refer to Section 1.3, Introduction to Scriptless Scripts. This bulleted list of contents is directly under the heading of each section. 

No numbering is used in the text - it appears in the link in the column to the left of the text.

Cross-references are inserted between references and the appearance of the referenced information in the text. These references are in square brackets and are listed at then end of each section in the order in which they appear in the text. Cross-references appear at the end of the section.

References:No bold or underlining. Only use italics for titles of newspapers, journals and magazines.

No full stops after authors' initials. Leave a space before initials. Author's name comes first.

When referencing electronic sources, the access date should be provided at the end of the Internet URL address. 

Upper and lower-case letters are used for headings at all levels.

Tables and figures in each section are numbered, with the table caption above the table and the figure caption below the figure, in upper and lower-case letters. Figures and tables are numbered sequentially, preceded by Figure x: or Table X:

An optional bulleted list of contributors appears at the end of the section content.

Appendices follow at the very end, after the optional list of contributors.
