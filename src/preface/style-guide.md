## Purpose

The purpose of this style guide is to provide contributors to the Tari Labs University (TLU) reports with standards for content and layout. 



## Standards for Content



### Spelling

Use the United States (US) spelling standard. The applicable dictionary is: (???) Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, latest edition??? 



### Units of Measure

Use the internationally agreed ISO standards (ISO 1000:1992) for expressing units of measure.

**Example:** min = minute, s = second, h = hour, g = gram. 



### Date and Time

- Date format: yyyy-mm-dd (year-month-date).
- Date format when written in text: 'The document was submitted for approval on 10 March 2019'.
- Time format (international): 11:00; 15:00.



### Abbreviations 

- If it is necessary to use abbreviations in a report, write the abbreviation out in full at its first occurrence in the text, followed by the abbreviation in brackets.
  **Example:** Tari Labs University (TLU), graphical user interface (GUI).
  Thereafter, use the abbreviation only.

- Abbreviations of units should be consistent and not changed in the plural.
  **Example:** 10 h and not 10 hrs; 5 min and not 5 mins.



### Spacing

- Use only one space after words, commas, full stops, colons, and semicolons.
- Leave a space between numbers and units of measure.
  **Example:** 5 min, 15 s, 120 Â°C (but 100Â°, 25%).

- Use a 'non-breaking space' (nbsp) to prevent numbers and units from being split over two lines.
  **Incorrect example:** The dimensions of the objects are: 2 m x 2 m x 1 m; 3 m x 2 m x 1 m; 1 m x 1 m x 50 mm; 4 m x 2
  m x 1 m; 1 m x 2 m x 3 m.
  **Correct example:** The dimensions of the objects are: 2 m x 2 m x 1 m; 3 m x 2 m x 1 m; 1 m x 1 m x 50 mm; 
  4&nbsp;m&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp; m&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;m; 1 m x 2 m x 3 m.

- Indicate clearly to which unit a number belongs:

  **Incorrect example:** 11 x 11 x 11 mm

  **Correct example:** 11 mm x 11 mm x 11 mm

- Use 'to' rather than a dash to indicate a range of values:

  **Incorrect example:** 1 - 10 cm

  **Correct example:** 1 cm to 10 cm

- Use an unbroken space `&nbsp;` space to indicate thousands.

  **Example:** 1&nbsp;000, 20&nbsp;000&nbsp;000, 250&nbsp;000.

- Leave a space on either side of signs such as + (plus), - (minus), = (equal to), > (greater than) and < (less than).



### Decimals and Numbers

- Use the decimal point and not the decimal comma.
- Write out numbers from one to nine in full in text; use Arabic numerals for 10 onwards.



### Quotation Marks

Use single quotation marks for a first quotation. Then use double quotation marks for a quotation within a quotation.



### List Punctuation

Where a list is a continuation of the preceding text, which is followed by a colon, use a semicolon between each bullet point, and end the list with a full stop.

**Example:** Their primary motivations for selecting a static emission rate are:

- there will be no upper limit on the amount of coins that can be created;
- the percentage of newly created coins compared to the total coins in circulation will tend toward zero;
- it will mitigate the effect of orphaned and lost coins;
- it will encourage spending rather than holding of coins.

Where a contains complete sentences, each item in the list is followed by a full stop.

**Example:** According to the proposed solution, one of three conditions will be true to the SPV client when using erasure codes:

1. The entire extended data is available, the erasure code is constructed correctly, and the block is valid.
2. The entire extended data is available, the erasure code is constructed correctly, but the block is invalid.
3. The entire extended data is available, but the erasure code is constructed incorrectly.



### Cross-referencing

- Insert cross-references between the referenced information in the text and the list of references.
- Text references appear in square brackets in the text and are listed under 'References' at the end of each section in the order in which they appear in the text.
- If a text reference appears at the end of a paragraph, it appears after the full stop at the end of the paragraph.
- Please be specific when referring to text, figures, tables, and references. For clarity, avoid using 'below' or 'above'. Rather give a specific paragraph, figure, table, or reference number.



## Standards for Layout



### Bulleted List of Contents

Every section in a TLU report starts with a bulleted list of all the headings in that section, for quick reference and consistency.
**Example:** Refer to Section 1.3, Introduction to Scriptless Scripts. The heading 'Contents' is not used before this list. ?? 



### Headings

- No numbering is used in the text panel. Numbering appears in the panel to the left of the text panel.
- Upper and lower-case letters are used for headings at all levels.



### Figures and Tables

- Figures and tables in each section are numbered sequentially, with the table caption above the table and the figure caption below the figure, in upper and lower-case letters.
- Figure and table captions are preceded by Figure x: or Table X:, as applicable.
- Figures and tables are centered on the page.



### Equations

**Note:** Discuss with Hansie. Some equations are centered, others are left justified - establish TLU's required standard.



### References 

List references in the following order, as applicable:

1. Author(s) name and initials (no full stops after initials, leave a space between initials).
2. Title of the article.
3. Title of journal.
4. Publication information (volume, number, etc.).
5. Page range.
6. Date you accessed the article (yyyy-mm-dd).

**Example:** Abe M, Ohkubo M and Suzuki K, 1-out-of-n Signatures from a Variety of Keys,
https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/ASIACRYPT/50/50.pdf. Date accessed: 2018-12-18.

Please note use of punctuation and full stops in the example. No italics are used. (Establish TLU's preference.)



### List of Contributors (Optional?)

An optional (?) bulleted list of contributors is included at the end of the section content, after the list of references.



### Appendices

Include any appendices at the very end of the report, after the optional (?) list of contributors.
