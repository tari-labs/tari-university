# Introduction 

Welcome to Tari Labs University (TLU). Our mission is to be the premier destination for balanced and accessible learning material for blockchain, digital currency 
and digital assets learning material.

We hope to make this a learning experience for us at TLU: as a means to grow our knowledge base and internal 
expertise or as a refresher. We think this will also be an excellent resource for anyone interested in the myriad 
disciplines required to understand blockchain technology.  

We would like this platform to be a place of learning accessible to anyone, irrespective of their degree of expertise. 
Our aim is to cover a wide range of topics that are relevant to the TLU space, starting at a beginner level and 
extending down a path of deeper complexity. 

You are welcome to contribute to our online content by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/issues) in [GitHub](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university). To help you get started, we've compiled a 
[Style Guide](../preface/style-guide.md) for TLU reports. Using this Style Guide, you can help us to 
ensure consistency in the content and layout of TLU reports.

## Errors, Comments and Contributions 

We would like this collection of educational presentations and videos to be a collaborative affair. This extends to our presentations. We are learning along with you. Our content may not be perfect first time around, so 
we invite you to alert us to errors and issues or, better yet, if you know how to make a pull request, to contribute a 
fix, write the correction and make a pull request.

As much as this learning platform is called Tari Labs University and will see input from many internal contributors and 
external experts, we would like you to contribute to new material, be it in the form of a suggestion of topics, varying 
the skill levels of presentations, or posting presentations that you may feel will benefit us as a growing community. 
In the words of Yoda, “Always pass on what you have learned.”  

## Guiding Principles

If you are considering contributing content to TLU, please be aware of our guiding principles:

1. The topic researched should be potentially relevant to the Tari protocol; chat to us on _**#tari-research**_ on IRC if 
you're not sure.
2. The topic should be thoroughly researched.
3. A critical approach should be taken (in the academic sense), with critiques and commentaries sought out and 
presented alongside the main topic. Remember that every white paper promises the world, so go and look for counterclaims.
4. A recommendation/conclusion section should be included, providing a critical analysis on whether or not the technology/
proposal would be useful to the Tari protocol.
5. The work presented should be easy to read and understand, distilling complex topics into a form that is accessible to 
a technical but non-expert audience. Use your own voice.

## Submission Process 

This is the basic submission process we follow within TLU. We would appreciate it if you, as an external contributor, follow the 
same process.

1. Get some agreement from the community that the topic is of interest.
2. Write up your report.
3. Push a first draft of your report as a pull request.
4. The community will peer-review the report, much the same as we would with a code pull request. 
5. The report is merged into the master. 
6. Receive the fame and acclaim that is due.
