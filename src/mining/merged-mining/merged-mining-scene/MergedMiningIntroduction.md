## What is Merged Mining? 

Merged mining is the act of using work done on another blockchain (the Parent) on one or more than one Auxiliary 
blockchain and to accept it as valid on its own chain, using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), which is the relationship 
between two blockchains for one to trust the other's work as their own. The Parent blockchain does not need to be aware 
of the AuxPoW logic, as blocks submitted to it are still valid blocks [[1]].

As an example, the structure of merged mined blocks in Namecoin and Bitcoin is shown here [[25]]:

<p align="center"><img src="sources/MergedMiningIntro01.png" width="700" /></p>

A transaction set is assembled for both blockchains. The hash of the AuxPoW block header is then inserted in the "free" 
bytes region (coinbase field) of the coinbase transaction and submitted to the Parent blockchain's Proof-of-Work (PoW). 
If the merge miner solves the block at the difficulty level of either blockchain or both blockchains, the respective 
block(s) are reassembled with the completed PoW and submitted to the correct blockchain. In the case of the Auxiliary 
blockchain, the Parent's block hash, Merkle tree branch and coinbase transaction are inserted in the Auxiliary block's 
AuxPoW header. This is to prove that enough work that meets the difficulty level of the Auxiliary blockchain was done 
on the Parent blockchain ([[1]], [[2]], [[25]]).

The propagation of Parent and Auxiliary blocks is totally independent and only governed by each chain's difficulty level. 
As an example, the following diagram shows how this can play out in practice with Namecoin and Bitcoin when the Parent 
difficulty (D<sub>BTC</sub>) is more than the Auxiliary difficulty (D<sub>NMC</sub>). Note that *BTC block 2'* did not 
become part of the Parent blockchain propagation.

## Merged Mining with Multiple Auxiliary Chains

A miner can use a single Parent to perform merged mining on multiple Auxiliary blockchains. The Merkle tree root of a 
Merkle tree that contains the block hashes of the Auxiliary blocks as leaves must then be inserted in the Parent's 
coinbase field as shown in the following diagram. To prevent double spending attacks, each Auxiliary blockchain must 
specify a unique ID that can be used to derive the leaf of the Merkle tree where the respective block hash must be 
located [[25]].

## Merged Mining - Interesting Facts and Case Studies

### Namecoin (#307) with Bitcoin (#1)

- Namecoin, the first fork of Bitcoin, introduced merged mining with Bitcoin [[1]] from block 19,200 onwards [[3]]. At 
the time of writing (May&nbsp;2018), the block height of Namecoin was greater than 400,500 [[4]].
- Over the five-day period from 23&nbsp;May&nbsp;2018 to 27&nbsp;May&nbsp;2018, only 226 out of 752 blocks posted 
transaction values over 
and above the block reward of 25 NMC, with an average transaction value of 159.231 NMC including the block reward. [[4]]
- Slush Pool merged mining Namecoin with Bitcoin rewards all miners with BTC equivalent to NMC via an external exchange 
service [[5]].
- P2pool, Multipool, Slush Pool, Eligius and F2pool are cited as top Namecoin merged mining pools [[6]].

###  Huntercoin (#779) with Bitcoin (#1) or Litecoin (#6)

- Huntercoin was released as a live experimental test to see how blockchain technology could handle full-on game 
worlds [[22]].
- Huntercoin was originally designed to be supported for only one year, but development and support will continue [[22]].
- Players are awarded coins for gaming, thus the world's first human mineable cryptocurrency.
- Coin distribution: 10 coins per block, nine for the game world and one for the miners [[22]].

exceptional 51% resistance [[23]].

### Monero (#12)/DigitalNote (#166) + FantomCoin (#1068)

- FantamCoin was the first CryptoNote-based coin to develop merged mining with Monero, but was abandoned until 
DigitalNote developers became interested in merged mining with Monero and revived FantamCoin in October&nbsp;2016 
([[17]], [[18]], [[19]]).

### Some Statistics

Merge-mined blocks in some cryptocurrencies on 18&nbsp;June&nbsp;2017 [[24]]:

<p align="center"><img src="./sources/MergedMiningStats-1.png" width="350" /></p>

### Observations

- The Auxiliary blockchain's target block times can be smaller than, equal to or larger than the Parent blockchain.
- The Auxiliary blockchain's hash rate is generally smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as that of, the 
Parent blockchain.
- A multi-PoW algorithm approach may further enhance 51% resistance.

## Attack Vectors

### 51% Attacks

- 51% attacks are real and relevant today. Bitcoin Gold (rank #28 @ 2018&#8209;05&#8209;29) and Verge (rank #33 @ 2018&#8209;05&#8209;29) 
suffered recent attacks with double spend transactions following ([[11]], [[12]]).

- In a conservative analysis, successful attacks on PoW cryptocurrencies are more likely when dishonest entities control 
more than 25% of the total mining power [[24]].
- Tari tokens are envisaged to be merged mined with Monero [[13]]. The Monero blockchain security is therefore important 
to the Tari blockchain. 
- Monero recently (6&nbsp;April&nbsp;2018) introduced a hard fork with upgraded PoW algorithm CryptoNight v7 at block height 
1,546,000 to maintain its Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) resistance and hence guard against 51% attacks. 
The Monero team proposes changes to their PoW every scheduled fork (i.e. every six months) ([[14]], [[15]]).
- An interesting question arises regarding what needs to happen to the Tari blockchain if the Monero blockchain is hard 
forked. Since the CryptoNight v7 hard fork, the network hash rate for Monero hovers around approximately 500MH/s, 
whereas in the two months immediately prior it was approximately 1,000MH/s [[20]](https://chainradar.com/xmr/chart). 
Thus 50% of the hash power can be ascribed to ASICS and botnet miners.

![MoneroHashRate](./sources/MoneroHashRate.png)

NiceHash statistics for CryptoNight v7 [[21]] show a lag of two days for approximately 100,600 miners to get up to speed 
with providing the new hashing power after the Monero hard fork.

 <p align="center"><img src="./sources/CryptoNight-v7.png" width="750" /></p>

The Tari blockchain will have to fork together with or just after a scheduled Monero fork. The Tari blockchain will be 
vulnerable to ASIC miners until it has been forked.

### Double Proof

- A miner could cheat the PoW system by putting more than one Auxiliary block header into one Parent block [[7]]. 
- Multiple Auxiliary blocks could be competing for the same PoW, and could subject your Auxiliary blockchain to 
nothing-at-stake attacks if the chain is forked, maliciously or by accident, with consequent attempts to reverse 
transactions ([[7]], [[26]]).
- More than one Auxiliary blockchain will be merge-mined with Monero.

### Analysis of Mining Power Centralization Issues

With reference to [[24]] and [[25]]:

- In Namecoin, F2Pool reached and maintained a majority of the mining power for prolonged periods.
- Litecoin has experienced slight centralization since mid-2014, caused by Clevermining and F2Pool, among others.
- In Dogecoin, F2Pool was responsible for generating more than 33% of the blocks per day for significant periods, even 
exceeding the 50% threshold around the end of 2016.
- Huntercoin was instantly dominated by F2Pool and remained in this state until mid-2016.
- Myriadcoin appears to have experienced only a moderate impact. Multi-merge-mined blockchains allow for more than one 
parent cryptocurrency and have a greater chance of acquiring a higher difficulty per PoW algorithm than the respective 
parent blockchain.
- Distribution of overall percentage of days below or above the centralization indicator thresholds on 18&nbsp;June&nbsp;2017 was 
as follows:

<p align="center"><img src="./sources/MergedMiningStats-2.png" width="350" /></p>

### Introduction of New Attack Vectors

 With reference to [[24]] and [[25]]:

- Miners can generate blocks for the merge-mined child blockchains at almost no additional cost, enabling attacks 
without risking financial losses.
- Merged mining as an attack vector works both ways, as parent cryptocurrencies cannot easily prevent being merge-mined 
by auxiliary blockchains.
- Merged mining can increase the hash rate of auxiliary blockchains, but it is not conclusively successful as a 
bootstrapping technique.
- Empirical evidence suggests that only a small number of mining pools are involved in merged mining, and they enjoy 
block shares beyond the desired security and decentralization goals.
