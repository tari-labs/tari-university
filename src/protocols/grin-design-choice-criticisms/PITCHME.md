# Monetary Policy Due to Static Emission Scheme

+++
## Bitcoin's Emission scheme

- Bitcoin - limited and finite supply of coins
	- 21 million coins
	- 10-minute block goal
	- First block reward: 50 BTC
	- Reward halved every 4 years

- What happens to newly minted coins?
	- New coins and transaction fees are paid to miners
	- Incentive to maintain the blockchain

+++
## What happens when all coins have been mined?

- Only transaction fees will be paid to miners
- Will transaction fees be sufficient to maintain a large network of miners?
- Possibility 1: Fixed supply
	- Fees will be sufficient
	- Over time transaction fees will increase
	- Mining hardware costs decrease
	- Maintaining the blockchain remain lucrative for small mining operations

- Possibility 2: Non-capped supply
	- Fees will be insufficient
	- Only large mining farms remain profitable
	- Centralisation of the network

+++
## Grin's Emission scheme

- Grin - Not capped to a fixed supply
- Static emission rate: constant 60 Grin block reward
- Block goal of 60 seconds
- Result in 1 coin being created every second

+++
## Grins motivations for static emission rate

- No upper limit on number of coins
- Inflation will tend to zero over time
- Mitigate the effect of lost coins
- Encourage spending rather than holding

+++
## The future value of Grin?

- Approximately 50 years for the inflation to drop below 2%
- Limit its use as a SoV, encourage MoE
- Experience constant price pressure
- Difficult for Grin to maintain a high value initially
- The Grin team believes a high inflation rate will:
	- Improve distribution of coins
	- Discourage holding of coins
	- Produce natural pricing
	- Limit price manipulation by large coin holders

+++
## Lost coins reduce high inflation

- Grin team believes the high inflation is much lower
- Many coins are lost and become unusable on a blockchain
- Lost coins account for upto 2% per year of the total supply
- Lost coins could be deducted from inflation rate

- Percentage of lost transactional coins are difficult to estimate:
	- More lost coins per year for low value coins
	- High value coins have lower rate of lost coins, users tend to be more careful

+++
## Deflation vs Inflation in fiat systems

- Most economists agree:
	- Deflation is bad as it increases debt
	- "Some" inflation is good as it stimulates the economy

+++
## Effect of inflation in fiat systems

- Inflationary currency: MoE rather than a SoV
- Positive effect of inflation:
	- Encourages the purchasing of goods and services
	- People with debt benefit from inflation
		- Eroding effect on total debt

- Negative effect of inflation:
	- Discourages saving 
		- Purchasing power of savings decrease over time
	- Encourages debt

+++
## Debt benefit does not apply to cryptocurrencies

- Not much debt exists

- Reason: Difficult to maintain successful borrower-lender relationships
	- Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies

+++
## Effect of deflation in fiat systems

- Deflationary currency: SoV rather than a MoE
- Positive effect of deflation:
	- Increase of purchasing power 
	- Encourages saving 
	- Discourages debt

- Negative effect of deflation:
	- Discourages the purchasing of goods and services
	- High deflation can cause a deflationary spiral
		- People with debt will have more debt 
		- People with money will start hoarding  		

- Bitcoin can be considered deflationary:
	- Buy and hold Bitcoins as the price per coin might increase over time
	- Limiting its use as a MoE

+++
## Who controls deflation and inflation?

- Traditional fiat systems:
	- Deflation:
		- Only happen in times of economic crisis and recession
		- Managed by introducing inflation 
	- Inflation:
		- Fiat systems are government backed
		- Control the amount of inflation to help alleviate government debt and finance budget deficits 
			- Could result in hyperinflation

- Cryptocurrency Systems:
	- Algorithmic and transparent monetary inflation/deflation 
	- Potentially not controlled by a central authority or government
	- Limiting its misuse

+++
## Balancing between SoV and MoE

- Finding a good balance between SoV and MoE is an important issue for developing a successful currency:
	- Try to motivate saving
	- Try to motivate spending
	- Worrying about debt -> probably not important

- A low inflationary model where inflation is algorithmically maintained seem like the safest choice

- Only time will tell if the high inflation model proposed by Grin will have the desired effect

# From ASIC Resistant to ASIC Friendly

+++
## Initial dual PoW algorithms proposed by Grin

- Two ASIC resistant PoW algorithms:
	- Cuckoo cycles
	- Equigrin

- Encourage mining decentralisation.
- High memory requirements
- Adjust parameters every 6 months to deter stealth ASIC mining 
- Move over to using only Cuckoo cycles as the primary PoW algorithm

+++
## New dual PoW algorithm proposal

- Dual PoW algorithm:
	- 1 ASIC friendly - Cuckatoo cycles
	- 1 ASIC resistant - vague details on second algorithm (Equigrin?)

- What is Cuckatoo cycles?
	- Variation of Cuckoo 
	- Aims to be more ASIC friendly: 
		- Plain bits for ternary counters
		- Requires large amounts of Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)
		- SRAM is used to speed up the memory latency bound access of random node bits
		- SRAM is limited on GPU and CPU processors
		- Increasing SRAM on ASIC processors is much easier

+++
## What are ASIC miners?

- Specialised hardware
- very efficient at solving specific PoW algorithms

- Benefits of being ASIC friendly:
	- Higher hash rate on network will make it more difficult to hack
	- Use less electrical power to maintaining blockchain

+++
## Negative effect of ASIC friendly PoW algorithm

- Network of miners will become more centralised

- General consumers do not have access or a need for this type of hardware
- ASIC miners are primarily reserved for enthusiasts and large corporations
- Localises majority of the networks hash rate in large mining farms

- Blockchain more vulnerable to 51% attacks
- Risk even higher when when hardware is preset to use a specific mining pool
- Mining pool might be controlled by single bad player

+++
## ASIC resistant mining

- Use general purpose and multi-use hardware for mining

- CPUs and GPUs that are primarily used for gaming and large workstations
- Network of miners is more widely distributed
- More difficult for single bad player to control more than 50% of the networks computational power
- Limiting the potential of double spends

+++
## ASIC resistant or ASIC friendly?

- Very important decision that can affect the security of the blockchain
- The Grin team's choice to support the ASIC community and trying to balancing an ASIC friendly and an ASIC resistant PoW algorithm will be interesting with many potential pitfalls

# Choice of Cryptographic Elliptic-curve - secp256k1

+++
## Elliptic curve cryptography and Secp256k1

- What is Elliptic curve cryptography?
	- Used to generate Private and Public key pairs
	- Digital signatures 
	- Authorisation of individuals and transactions
	- More secure than RSA (smaller keys for similar security)

- Secp256k1 is an elliptic curve:
	- Defined in the Standards for Efficient Cryptography
	- Used for digital signatures in a number of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Litecoin, etc)

+++
## Security of Secp256k1

- Grin uses Secp256k1

- Some security experts recommend not using the secp256k1:
	- Some issues have been uncovered, but not necessarily exploited
	- Complex-multiplication field discriminant is not high enough to be secure
	- Curves with low complex-multiplication field discriminant tend to be easier to break
	- Could result in  future exploits

+++
## Alternative cryptographic curves

- Starting a project with a potentially compromised curve does not seem like a good idea

- Alternative curves with better security properties do exist: 
	- Curve25519 
	- Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)  -> Ed25519 public-key signature system
	- Fast signature scheme without sacrificing security

+++
## Additional alternatives using SafeCurves

- SafeCurves Link:  https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/
- Maintained by Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanje Lange
- Evaluate security properties and potential vulnerabilities of many curves
- Easier to investigate and select an alternative curve

# Selection of Key-store Library

+++
## Selecting the "best" key-value store library

- Grin originally made use of RocksDB as an internal key-value store
- Many key-store libraries exist with different performance and security characteristics:
	- RocksDB
	- LevelDB
	- HyperLevelDB
	- LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)

- Selecting the "best" key-value store library is difficult?

+++
## Conflicting online benchmarks

- Many conflicting online benchmarks:
	- As an example: some show that RocksDB or LevelDB are better than LMDB
	- Which is not the case

- Howard Chu wrote the article "Lies, Damn Lies, Statistics, and Benchmarks"
	- Expose these online benchmarking issues
	- Testing problems: Random records were incorrectly selected 
	- LMDB is the best key-value store library
	- Other benchmarks performed by Symas Corp support this claim

+++
## Grin switched to LMDB

- Grin later replaced RocksDB with LMDB
	- Wallet state
	- Blockchain storage

- Probably a good idea as LMDB seem to be the best key-value store library for blockchain related applications

---
## Conclusions

- Selecting an emission rate to create a sustainable monetary system is important
  - Try to find a balance between SoV and/or a MoE
- Being ASIC friendly vs ASIC resistant need to be carefully evaluated
- Cryptographic curves with potential security vulnerabilities should rather be ignored
  - SafeCurves can be used to select a secure elliptic curve
- Be careful when trusting online benchmarks when selecting libraries
