# Block Chain Related Protocols

## Purpose

A block chain protocol is a common term for consensus methods. These methods are different systems that are implemented to reach consensus and validate transactions within a block chain network[ ].

## Definitions

- From [<u>**Wikipedia - 1**</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

  A block chain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).

- From [<u>**Wikipedia - 2**</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol)

  A security protocol (cryptographic protocol or encryption protocol) is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the algorithms should be used. A sufficiently detailed protocol includes details about data structures and representations, at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program.

- From [<u>**Market Protocol**</u>](https://medium.com/market-protocol/blockchain-crash-course-protocols-dapps-apis-and-dexs-4c324964f9c2)

  A protocol can be seen as a methodology agreed upon by two or more parties that establish a common set of rules that they can agree upon so as to enter into a binding agreement. Protocols are therefore the set of rules that govern the network. Block chain protocols usually include rules about consensus, transaction validation, and network participation.

- From [<u>**Encyclopaedia Britannica**</u>](https://www.britannica.com/technology/protocol-computer-science)

  Protocol, in computer science, is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit packets.
