# Blockchain-related Protocols

## Purpose

A blockchain protocol is a common term for consensus methods. These methods are different systems that are implemented 
to reach consensus and validate transactions within a blockchain network [[1]].

## Definitions

- From [<u>**Wikipedia - 1**</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain): A blockchain is a growing list of records, 
called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a 
time stamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree root hash) [[2]].

- From [<u>**Wikipedia - 2**</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol): A security protocol 
(cryptographic protocol or encryption protocol) is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a security-related 
function and applies cryptographic methods, often as sequences of cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the 
algorithms should be used. A sufficiently detailed protocol includes details about data structures and representations, 
at which point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program [[3]].

- From [<u>**Market Protocol**</u>](https://medium.com/market-protocol/blockchain-crash-course-protocols-dapps-apis-and-dexs-4c324964f9c2):
A protocol can be seen as a methodology agreed upon by two or more parties that establish a common set of rules that  
they can agree upon so as to enter into a binding agreement. Protocols are therefore the set of rules that govern the 
network. Blockchain protocols usually include rules about consensus, transaction validation and network participation [[4]].

- From [<u>**Encyclopaedia Britannica**</u>](https://www.britannica.com/technology/protocol-computer-science): Protocol, 
in computer science, is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. 
In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be 
structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be 
sending its data in eight-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit packets [[5]].
