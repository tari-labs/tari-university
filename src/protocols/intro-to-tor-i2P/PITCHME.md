# Introduction to I2P
## The invisible internet project

---
# What is I2P

* Anonymity network 
* Secure network (Communication is encrypted)
* Low-latency network
* Generally confused with Tor / VPN networks

---

# How does it work
* Enclosed network within the internet
* Peer to peer communication
  * Very little communication with internet
  * Has it's own websites - Eepsites
  * no IP address but cryptographic ID's. 
 * Each Connected client is a router

# Infrastructure

## Routing Infrastructure and Anonymity
* Installing I2P routing service within a client's device.
* Router creates temporary, encrypted, one-way connections with I2P routers on other devices.
* Connections are one way because they are made up of an Outbound Tunnel and an Inbound Tunnel
* Messages sent from one device do not travel directly to the inbound tunnel of the destination device. 
* Instead, the outbound router queries a distributed network database for the corresponding address of the inbound router.

---
## Tunnels and How they work

* Router information and destination information is stored in a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). 
* For each application/client, the I2P router keeps a pool of tunnel pairs. 
* Exploratory tunnels for interactions with the network database are shared among all users of a router. 
* If a tunnel in the pool is about to expire or if the tunnel is no longer usable, the router creates a new tunnel and adds it to the pool.
* Tunnels periodically expire, every ten minutes, and hence, need to be refreshed frequently. (Security Measure)

### Router Information:

When a message is leaving one router, it needs to know some key pieces of data (known as RouterInfo) about the other router. The destination router info is stored in the NetDB with the router's identity as the key

* The router's identity - an encryption key, a signing key and a certificate.
* The contact addresses at which it can be reached - protocol, Internet Protocol (IP), port.
* When this was created or published.
* Options - a set of arbitrary text options, e.g. bandwidth of router.
* The signature of the above, generated by the identity's signing key.

## Floodfill Routers 
* Foodfill routers are responsible for storing the NetDB. 
* 6% of the network
* Participation is automatic or manual - dependent on bandwidth.

## Garlic Routing

- This is a way of building paths/tunnels through which messages/data in the I2P network travels. 
* Provides layered encryption; and
* Bundles multiple messages together

---
# How Tor works - compared to I2P
* Volunteer relay nodes. Relay nodes are responsible for creating hops through which data is routed.
* The circuit is extended one hop at a time, 
* Each relay along the way knows only which relay gave it data and which relay it is giving data to. 
* No individual relay ever knows the complete path that a data packet has taken. Also no request uses the same path.

# Differences between I2P and Tor
| I2P                                     | Tor                       |
| ---------------------------------       | --------------------------|
| Fully peer to peer: Self-organizing Nodes | Fully Peer to Peer: Volunteer Relay Nodes                         |
| Query NetDB to find destinationâ€™s inbound tunnel gateway | Relays Data to the closest relay     |
| Limited to no exit nodes. Internal communication only | Designed and optimized for exit traffic, with a large number of exit nodes          |
| Designed primarily for file sharing    | Designed for anonymous Internet access |
| Unidirectional tunnels                 | Rendezvous point                        |
| Significantly smaller user base      | Generally bigger user base        |
