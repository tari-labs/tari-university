## Background

Invisible Internet Project (I2P), Tor and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are well-known anonymity networks. They are 
all designed in different ways and for specific uses though most people use them with the intent of privately browsing 
the internet. In their functions, these networks have very similar characteristics but also have important 
differentiators in the how they work to anonymise and secure the internet traffic of users.

In this report, we'll examine what the I2P network is, the paradigms of how it works, its security infrastructure and its
potential or known use-cases in the blockchain domain.

## Introduction to I2P Network

### What is I2P?

I2P (known as the Invisible Internet Project - founded in 2003) is a low-latency network layer that runs on a distributed 
network of computers across the globe. It is primarily built into applications such as email, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and file 
sharing [[6]]. It works by automatically making each client in the network a node; through which data and traffic is routed. 
These nodes are responsible for providing encrypted, one-way connections to and from other computers within the network. 

### How does it Work?

I2P is an enclosed network that runs within the Internet infrastructure (referred to as the clearnet in this paradigm). 
Unlike VPNs and Tor, which are inherently "outproxy" networks designed to anonymous and privately communication with the 
Internet, I2P is designed as a peer to peer network. This means it has very little to no communication with the internet. 
This also means identifying each node in I2P is not done with an IP address but a cryptographic identifier. ([[1]], [[2]]). 
A node in the I2P network can either be a server that hosts a darknet service (similar to a website on the internet), or 
a client who accesses the servers and services hosted by other nodes [[6]]. Tor, on the other hand, works by using a group 
of volunteer-operated relay servers/nodes that allow people to privately and securely access the internet. This means 
people can choose to volunteer as a relay node in the network and hence donate bandwidth. [[13]]. Compared to Tor, each 
client/server in I2P is automatically a relay node. Whether data is routed through a specific node is normally bandwidth 
dependent. 

**Eepsites** Since there is no *internet* in I2P, the network is made up of its own anonymous and hidden sites (called 
*eepsites*). These exist only within the network and are only accessible to people using I2P. Services such as 
**I2PTunnel**, that use a standard web server, can be used to create sites like these.

### Infrastructure

#### Routing Infrastructure and Anonymity

I2P works by installing an I2P routing service within a client's device. This router creates temporary, encrypted, one-way 
connections with I2P routers on other devices. Connections are referred to as one way because they are made up of 
an *Outbound Tunnel* and an *Inbound Tunnel*. During any communication, data leaves the client's devices via the 
outbound tunnels and is received on other devices through their inbound tunnels. Hence, this means messages/data doesn't 
travel in two directions within the same tunnel. Therefore, a single round-trip request message and its response between 
two parties needs four tunnels [[4]], as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. Messages sent from one device do not travel directly to 
the inbound tunnel of the destination device. Instead, the outbound router queries a distributed network database for 
the corresponding address of the inbound router. This database is comprised of a custom Kademlia style Distributed Hash 
Table (DHT) that contains the router information and destination information. For each application/client, the I2P router 
keeps a pool of tunnel pairs. Exploratory tunnels for interactions with the network database are shared among all users of
a router. If a tunnel in the pool is about to expire or if the tunnel is no longer usable, the router creates a new tunnel
and adds it to the pool. It is important to recall later that tunnels periodically expire, every ten minutes, and hence,
need to be refreshed frequently. This is one of I2P's security measures that is performed to prevent long-lived tunnels 
from becoming a threat to anonymity [[3]].

#### Distributed Network Database

The NetDB, discussed earlier, is implemented as a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and is propagated via nodes known as 
floodfill routers using the Kademlia protocol. The NetDB is one of the characteristics that makes I2P decentralised. To 
start participating in the network, a router installs a part of the NetDB. Obtaining the partial NetDB is called 
bootstrapping and happens by ’reseeding’ the router. By default, a router will reseed the first time by querying some 
bootstrapped domain names. When a router successfully establishes a connection to one of these domains, a Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) connection is set up through which the router downloads a signed partial copy of the NetDB. Once 
the router can reach at least one other participant in the network, the router will query for other parts of the NetDB 
it does not have itself. [[12]]

The NetDB stores two types of data: 
1. **Router Info and how this works:**
When a message is leaving one router, it needs to know some key pieces of data (known as *RouterInfo*) about the other 
router. The destination router info is stored in the NetDB with the router's identity as the key. To request a resource 
(or RouterInfo), a client requests the desired key from the node considered to be closest to the key. If the piece of 
data is located at the node, it is returned to the client. Otherwise, the node uses its local knowledge of participating 
nodes and returns the node it considers to be nearest to the key. [[3]]. The router info in the NetDB is made up of: ([[4]], [[6]]):

    - The router's identity - an encryption key, a signing key and a certificate.
    - The contact addresses at which it can be reached - protocol, Internet Protocol (IP), port.
    - When this was created or published.
    - Options - a set of arbitrary text options, e.g. bandwidth of router.
    - The signature of the above, generated by the identity's signing key.

2. **LeaseSets:** 
The LeaseSet specifies a tunnel entry point to reach an endpoint. This specifies the routers that can directly contact 
the desired destination. It contains the following data:

    - Tunnel gateway router - given by specifying its identity.
    - Tunnel ID - tunnel used to send messages.
    - Tunnel expiration - when the tunnel will expire.
    - Destination itself - similar to router identity.
    - Signature - used to verify the LeaseSet.

#### Floodfill Routers

Special routers, referred to as *floodfill routers*, are responsible for storing the NetDB. Participation in the floodfill 
pool can either be automatic or manual. Automatic participation occurs whenever the number of floodfill routers drops 
below a certain threshold, which is currently 6% of all nodes in the network ([[6]], [[7]]). When this happens, a node is 
selected to participate as a floodfill router based on criteria such as uptime and bandwidth. It should be noted that 
approximately 95% of floodfill routers are automatic [[8]]. The NetDB is stored in a DHT format within 
the floodfill routers. A resource is requested from the floodfill router considered to be closest to that key. To have a 
higher success rate on a lookup, the client is able to iteratively look up the key. This means that the lookup continues 
with the next-closest peer should the initial lookup request fail.

#### Garlic Routing

Garlic routing is a way of building paths/tunnels through which messages/data in the I2P network travels. When a message
leaves the application/client, it is encrypted to the recipient's public key. That encrypted message is then encrypted with
instructions specifying the next hop. This message travels in this way through each hop until it reaches the recipient.
During the transportation of the message, it is bundled with other messages. This means that any message
travelling in the network could contain a number of other messages bundled with it. In essence, garlic routing does two
things:

- provides layered encryption; and
- bundles multiple messages together.

Figure&nbsp;2 illustrates the end-to-end message bundling:

## Threat Model, Security and Vulnerability Attacks

The I2P project has no explicit threat model specified but rather talks about common attacks and existing defenses 
against them. Overall, the design of I2P is motivated by threats similar to those addressed by Tor: The attacker can
observe traffic locally but not all traffic flowing through the network and integrity of all cryptographic primitives is 
assumed. Furthermore, an attacker is only allowed to control a limited amount of peers in the network (the website talks 
about not more than 20% of nodes participating in the NetDB and a similar percentage of total amount of nodes controlled 
by the malicious entity). In this section, we'll look at different threat models affecting the network. [[3]]

### Sybil Attacks

The Sybil attack, illustrated in Figure&nbsp;3, is a well-known anonymity system attack in which the malicious user 
creates multiple identities in an effort to increase control over the network. Running this over the I2P network is 
rather difficult. This is because participants/clients in the network evaluate the performance of peers when selecting 
peers to interact with, instead of using a random sample. Because running multiple identities on the same host affects 
the performance of each of those instances, the number of additional identities running in parallel is effectively 
limited by the need to provide each of them with enough resources to be considered as peers. This means that the 
malicious user will need a substantial amount of resources to create multiple identities.

<p align="center"><a name="fig_eca"> </a><img src="assets/Sybil Attack.png" width="750" /></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure&nbsp;3: Sybil Attack Illustration [<a href="https://www.delaat.net/rp/2017-2018/p97/presentation.pdf" title="Network Topology">5</a>]</b></p>

### Eclipse Attacks

In eclipse attacks, a set of malicious and colluding nodes arranges that a good node can 
only communicate with malicious nodes. The union of malicious nodes therefore fools the good node into writing its
addresses into neighbouring lists of good nodes. In a Sybil attack, a single malicious node possesses a large number of 
identities in the network in-order to control some part of the network. If an attacker wants to continue a Sybil attack 
into an eclipse attack, the attacker will try to place malicious nodes in the strategic routing path in such a way that 
all traffic will pass through the attacker's node. [[8]].

### Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks on the I2P network can be mounted by actively watching the network's messages as they pass between 
all of the nodes and attempt to correlate messages and their routes. Since all peers in the network are frequently 
sending messages, this attack is trivial. The attacker can send out large amounts of data (more than 2GB), observe all 
the nodes and narrow down those that routed the message. Transmission of a large chunk of data is necessary because 
inter-router communication is encrypted and streamed, i.e. 1,024&nbsp;byte data is indistinguishable from 2,048&nbsp;byte 
data. Mounting this attack is, however, very difficult and one would need to be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or 
government entity in order to observe a large chunk of the network.

### Intersection Attacks

Intersection attacks involve observing the network and node churns over time, and intersecting the peers that are online 
when a message is transferred through the network, in order to narrow down specific targets. It is theoretically 
possible to mount this attack if the network is small, but impractical with a larger network.

### Denial of Service Attacks

Denial of service attacks include the following:

#### Greedy User Attack

A greedy user attack occurs when a user is consuming significantly more resources than they are willing to contribute. 
I2P has strong defences against these attacks, as users within the network are routers by default and hence contribute 
to the network by design.

#### Starvation Attack

A user/node may try to launch a starvation attack by creating a number of bad nodes that do not provide any resources or 
services to the network, causing existing peers to search through a larger network database or request more tunnels than 
should be necessary. An attempt to find useful nodes can be difficult, as there are no differences between them and 
failing or loaded nodes. However, I2P, by design, maintains a profile of all peers and attempts to identify and ignore 
poorly performing nodes, making this attack difficult.

#### Flooding Attack

In a flooding attack, the malicious user sends a large number of messages to the target's inbound tunnels or to the 
network at large. The targeted user can, however, detect this by the contents of the message and because the tunnel's 
tests will fail. The user can hence identify the unresponsive tunnels, ignore them and build new ones. They can also 
choose to throttle the number of messages a tunnel can receive. Although I2P has no defences against a network flooding 
attack, it is incredibly difficult to flood the network.

## How Tor works and Comparison with I2P

As previously mentioned, Tor works through volunteer relay nodes. These relay nodes, like I2P's nodes, are responsible 
for creating hops through which data is routed before reaching its intended destination on the Internet. They work by 
incrementally building a circuit of encrypted connections through relays on the network. The circuit is extended one hop 
at a time, and each relay along the way knows only which relay gave it data and which relay it is giving data to. No 
individual relay ever knows the complete path that a data packet has taken. Also no request uses the same path. Later 
requests are given a new circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones. This process is also 
known as Onion Routing [[14]]. See the image below: 

<p align="center"><a name="fig_eca"> </a><img src="assets/htw3.png" width="750" /></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure&nbsp;4: How Tor Works - Illustration [<a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en" title="How Tor Works">13</a>]</b></p>

### Onion Routing - How is works

Onion Routing is essentially a distributed overlay network designed to anonymize TCP-based applications like web browsing, 
secure shell, and instant messaging. Clients choose a path through the network and build a circuit, in which each node, 
in the path knows its predecessor and successor, but no other nodes in the circuit. Traffic flows down the circuit in 
fixed-size cells, which are unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node (like the layers of an onion) and relayed 
downstream. [[14]]


The designated use of relay nodes in the Tor network gives the network a couple of important characeristics: 
- The stability of the network is proportional to the number of relay nodes in the network. The less the relay nodes the 
less stable the network becomes. 
- The security of the network is also proportional to the number of relay nodes. A network with more active relay nodes 
is less vulnerable against attacks. 
- Finally, the speed of the network is proportional to the number of relay nodes. The more nodes there are the faster 
the network becomes. [[13]]

### Types of Tor Relays/Nodes Routing

Tor's relay nodes do not all function in the same way. There are four types of relay nodes - a Guard/Entry, Middle, Exit and Bridge node. 

<p align="center"><a name="fig_eca"> </a><img src="assets/torCircuit.png" width="750" /></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure&nbsp;5: The Tor Circuit [<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/tor-nodes-explained-580808c29e2d" title="The Tor Circuit">14</a>]</b></p>

#### Guard or Entry Relay (Non-exit Relay)

A guard relay is the first relay in the Tor circuit. Each client that wants to connect to the Tor network will first 
connect to a Guard relay. This means guard nodes can see the IP Address of the client attempting to connect. It is 
worth noting that Tor publishes it's guard nodes and hence anyone can see them on websites such as this one: [[15]] 
Because seeing the IP address of a client is possible, there have been cases where attackers have filtered out traffic 
on the network using Circuit Fingerprinting techniques such as is documented in this paper [[16]].

#### Middle Relay

These cover most parts of the Tor network and act as hops. They consist of relays through which data is passed in 
encrypted format. No node knows more than its predecessor and descendant. All the available middle relay nodes show 
themselves to the guard and exit nodes so that any may connect to them for transmission. Middle relays can never be exit 
relays within the network. [[13]]

#### Exit Relay

Exit relay nodes act as a bridge between the Tor network and the internet, and they send data to the desired 
destinations on the internet. The services Tor clients are connecting to (website, chat service, email provider, etc) 
will see the IP address of the exit relay instead of the real IP addresses of Tor users. Because of this, exit relay 
owners are often are subject to numerous legal complaints and shut down threats. [[13]]

#### Bridge Relay

The design of the Tor network means that the IP address of Tor relays is public as previously mentioned and shown here [[15]]. 
Because of this, Tor can be blocked by governments or ISPs by blacklisting the IP addresses of these public Tor nodes. 
Tor Bridges are nodes in the network that are not listed in the public Tor directory, making it harder for ISPs and 
governments to block them. They are meant for people who want to run Tor from their homes, have a static IP or don't 
have much bandwidth to donate. [[13]]

## Conclusion

In summary, Tor and I2P are two types of networks that anonymise and encrypt data transferred within them. Each network 
is uniquely designed for a respective function. The I2P network is a designed for moving data in a Peer to Peer peer 
format, whereas Tor is designed for accessing the internet privately. 

Extensive research exists and continues to find ways to improve the security of these networks in their respective 
operational designs. This research becomes especially important when control of a network may mean monetary losses, loss 
of privacy or denial of service.
