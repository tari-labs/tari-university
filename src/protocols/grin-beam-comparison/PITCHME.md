## Introduction

- Mimblewimble is a newly proposed blockchain architecture based on Pederson commitments.
    - Offers built-in privacy
    - Very compact blockchain   
- Grin's stated goal is to produce a minimalistic reference implementation of Mimblewimble.
- BEAM has however made many modifications to the original Mimblewimble approach to achieve new features.
- Some raw implementation differences:

## Dandelion Relay
One piece of functionality that both projects implement outside of Mimblewimble is the Dandelion relay mechanism.

- **Two phases:**
    - *Stem phase (Anonymity phase)*: Randomly forwards the transaction one peer at a time for a random distance
    - *Fluff phase (Spreading phase)*: Broadcast the transactions to the whole network

## Grin unique features
Grin has implemented is **Partial History** syncing. This feature lets a new node to sync to the blockchain very quickly.

1. A new node queries the current head block of the chain and requests the data up to a horizon (e.g. 5000 previous blocks)
2. The node checks the embedded proofs to to see if there is enoguh data to confirm consensus.
3. If not it will increase the horizon depth and repeat the consensus check.
4. Once a horizon is found that provides enough data for consensus the full UTXO set is downloaded at the horizon.

## BEAM unique features
BEAM has proposed quite a number of extensions to Mimblewimble to implement new features. Most are discussed in whitepapers and announcements but the features listed here were found in the code on Github so appear to be implemented.
+++
## BEAM Transactions
- Both confidential and non-confedential UXTOs
    - Confidential UTXOs are signed by Bulletproofs 
    - Non-confidential UTXOs are signed using a custom non-confedential signature
- BEAM supports an explicit incubation period on UTXO's
- BEAM supports timelocked transactions that specify a minimum and maximum time threshold.
+++
## Auditable transactions
Mimblewimble transactions are inherently private which is a desirable default. However, a business might need to demonstrate compliance to an authority.

BEAM implements auditable transactions.
- A second private/public key pair is generated by the wallet
- This key pair is used to tag the transaction
- The public key can be given to an auditing authority and used to reveal the transactions to them.
- The authority cannot use this key to tag other transactions.

+++
## Reusing transaction kernels
Mimblewimble performs a cut-through process that clears out intermediate transactions from the blockchain. However, transaction kernels for every transaction are retained.

Beam supports the reuse of previous transactions kernels.
- A multiplier is applied to the prior kernel to produce a new one.
- Incentivised through lower fees.
+++
## Secure BBS system for building transactions
Mimblewimble transactions need to be interactivelty built by the participants.
- Grin achieves through through a direct socket connections.
- BEAM implements a secure BBS system that is hosted on each node.
    - Supports non-real-time transaction negotiation.

+++
## One-sided transactions
BEAM supports constructing a one-sided transaction which is signed by the payee and sent to the payer to be completed and published to the blockchain.

This is not possible in standard Mimblewimble as it would reveal the payee's blinding factor.

BEAM implements a process called kernel fusion which is a thing that does stuff.

## Radix-Hash trees
better than Merkle Trees?

## Planned features
some features that might happen?
- Embedding contract text
- Confedential assets?
