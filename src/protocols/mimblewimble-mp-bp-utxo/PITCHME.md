## Introduction

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

Mimblewimble does not have a Bitcoin-type multisig applied to a UTXO. In Bitcoin, multisig payments are usually combined 
with P2SH to send funds to a P2SH payment address. The redeem script sets the conditions for the UTXOs linked to the 
P2SH payment address to be spent.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Mimblewimble transactions do not involve payment addresses. The UTXO can be spent if the Pedersen Commitment can be 
opened/unlocked; does not require an "owner" signature. A typical Mimblewimble UTXO looks like this:

<div class="mywrap">08c15e94ddea81e6a0a31ed558ef5e0574e5369c4fcba92808fe992fbff68884cc</div>

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Mimblewimble commitments are totally confidential and ownership cannot be proved. Also all senders receivers must 
interact to conclude a Tx.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

We need to utilize Mimblewimble in a different way to enable multiparty UTXO functionality.

## Review of Bitcoin $ m\text{-of-}n $ Multisig

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

A typical $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ Bitcoin P2SH multisig redeem script:

<div class="mywrap">
```
redeemScript = <OP_2> <A pubkey> <B pubkey> <C pubkey> <OP_3> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
```
</div>

The P2SH payment address:

<div class="mywrap">
```
redeemScriptHash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(redeemScript))
```
</div>

<div class="mywrap">
```
P2SHAddress = base58check.Encode("05", redeemScriptHash)
```
</div>

Generic funding transaction's output script for the P2SH payment address:

<div class="mywrap">
```
scriptPubKey = OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```
</div>

A 2-of-3 multisig redeem transaction's input script

<div class="mywrap">
```
scriptSig = OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript>
```
</div>

The combined spending and funding transaction script:

<div class="mywrap">
```
validationScript = OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript> OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```
</div>

## Security Aspects

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

Mimblewimble relies on Pedersen Commitments and range proofs (i.e. BP range proofs) to provide security.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Pedersen Commitments $ C(v,k) = (vH + kG) $ provide perfectly hiding and computationally binding commitments. 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

An adversary with infinite computing power can determine alternate pairs 
$ v ^\prime , k ^\prime $ such that $ C(v,k) = C(v ^\prime , k ^\prime) $ in a reasonable time to open the commitment 
to another value when challenged (computationally binding). However, it will be impossible to determine the specific 
pair $ v, k $ used to create the commitment, because there are multiple pairs that can produce the same $ C $ (perfectly 
hiding).

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Anyone can try to spend or mess with unspent coins embedded in commitments, but BP range proofs assure that all values 
are in the range $ [0,2^{64} - 1] $ and also stop third parties locking away one's funds.

@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

Let $ (v\_1 H + k\_1 G) $ be Alice' commitment that Bob ties to lock away. He knows Mimblewimble commitments are 
additionally homomorphic; he can theoretically use Alice's commitment in a Tx and create a new opposing 
output that sums to a commitment of the value of $ 0 $, $ (0H + kG) = (kG) = (\mathbf{0}) $.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Bob will attempt to add an additional blinding factor $ k\_{x} $ to the commitment:

@divend

`
$$
(v_1 H + (k_1 + k_x) G) - (v_1 H + k_1 G) - (v_2 H + k_2 G) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H = (\mathbf{0})
$$
`

@div[text-left]

This new UTXO $ (v\_1 H + (k\_1 + k\_x) G) $ would be equally unspendable by Alice and Bob. Fortunately a BP range proof 
cannot be constructed as the values of $ v\_1 $ and $ k\_1 + k\_x $ must be known, so the miners will not accept.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

However, if Bob and Alice work together, it should be possible to create a BP range proof for a $ 2\text{-of-}2 $ 
multisig type Tx.

@divend

## Mimblewimble $ n\text{-of-}n $ Multiparty BP UTXO

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

Alice, Bob and Carol agree to set up a multiparty $ 3\text{-of-}3 $ multisig fund that they can control together. They 
decide to use a sharing hash function $ val\_H = \text{H}\_{s}(arg) $ as a handshaking mechanism:

@divend

1. Send hash $ val\_H $ to all
1. Send value $ arg $ to all
1. Verify and proceed, or stop
1. Denoted by $ \text{share:} $ 

@div[text-left]

<div class="LineHeight2o0per"> <br></div>

They are now ready to proceed: [Setting up the Multiparty Funding Transaction](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/MainReport.html#setting-up-the-multiparty-funding-transaction)


@divend

+++

@div[text-left]

All good so far. Alice, Bob and Carol could each keep their shared blinding factor $ k\_n $ secret. 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

They must now use a secure method to calculate their combined BP range proof for commitment 
$ (v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) $ without giving up their portion of the shared blinding factor.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

We will now investigate 2 alternatives to construct such a BP range proof.

@divend

1. [Utilizing Bulletproofs MPC Protocol](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/MainReport.html#utilizing-bulletproofs-mpc-protocol)
1. [Utilizing Grin's Shared Bulletproof Computation](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/MainReport.html#utilizing-grins-shared-bulletproof-computation)


@div[text-left]

<div class="LineHeight2o0per"> <br></div>

Let us now compare these two BP range proof (RP) methods:

@divend

| Rounds        | Three                                                        | Two                                                          |
| Security      | Use Merlin transcripts: more secure against replay attacks.  | No specific sharing protocol suggested.                      |

| Wallet        | Each RP's data accessible within aggregated RP. The colored coin can be identified & wallet reconstructed (initial blinding factor seed, BP RP rewinding). | Wallet cannot be reconstructed, a single party's blinding factor cannot be distinguished from the combined RP. |

@div[text-left]

Alice, Bob and Carol had a private bet going that Carol won, and they agree to spend the multiparty UTXO to pay Carol 
her winnings, with the change being used to set up a consecutive multiparty UTXO. 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

They do this as follows: [Spending the Multiparty UTXO](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/MainReport.html#spending-the-multiparty-utxo)

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

The friends have been wondering about the odd occasion that all three will not be present, so they now need a solution 
for a $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ scheme.

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

Mimblewimble transactions cannot utilize a smart/redeem script in the form of a P2SH, but similar functionality can be 
implemented in the users' wallets. For the $ m\text{-of-}n $ multiparty BP UTXO, the SSSS will be used to enable such Txs. 

@divend

---

## Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

@div[text-left]

With SSSS $ n $ parties carry one shard (share) $ f(i) $ for $ i \in \lbrace 1 , \ldots , n \rbrace $ 
each of a secret $ s $, such that any $ m $ can reconstruct the message. 

<div class="LineHeight20per"> <br></div>

The basic idea: it is possible to draw an infinite number of polynomials of degree $ m $ through $ m $ points, whereas 
$ m+1 $ points are required to define a unique polynomial of degree $ m $. This can be visualized on a two-dimensional 
plane:

@divend

@div[s200px]
![SSSS Simple ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tari-labs/tari-university/master/src/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/sources/shamir_simple.png)
@divend

@div[text-left]

The shards will be distributed according to Pedersenâ€™s Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme, to enable each party to verify that their shard is correct. Let us look more closely 
at the SSSS and Pedersenâ€™s VSS definitions [here](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/mimblewimble-mp-bp-utxo/MainReport.html#appendix-b-definition-of-terms).
