## Introduction

In [Mimblewimble](../mimblewimble-1/MainReport.md) the concept of a Bitcoin type multi-signature (multisig) applied to an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) does not really exist. 

In Bitcoin, multisig payments are usually combined with Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) functionality as a means to send funds to a P2SH payment address and then to manage its expenditure from there. The redeem script itself sets the conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the UTXOs linked to the P2SH payment address to be spent [[[1]], [[2]]). 

Unlike Bitcoin, Mimblewimble transactions do not involve payment addresses as all transactions are confidential. The only requirement for a Mimblewimble UTXO to be spent is the ability to open (or unlock) the [Pederson Commitment](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments) and does not require an "owner" signature.



## Notation Used

This section gives the general notation of mathematical expressions used. It provides important pre-knowledge for the remainder of the report.

- All Pederson Commitments will be of the [elliptic derivative]((../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments)) depicted by $  C(v,k) = (vH + kG)  $ with $ v $ being the value committed to and $ k $ being the blinding factor.
- Scalar multiplication will be depicted by "$ \cdot $", as an example $ e \cdot (vH + kG) = e \cdot vH + e \cdot kG  $.
- A Pederson Commitments to the value of $ 0 $ will be depicted by $ C(0,k) = (0H + kG) = (kG) = (\mathbf{0}) $.



## Bitcoin $ m\text{-of-}n $ Multisig in a Nutshell

Multiple use cases of $ m\text{-of-}n $ multisig applications exist, for example a $ 1\text{-of-}2 $ petty cash account, or a $ 2\text{-of-}2 $ two-factor authentication wallet, or a $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ board of directors account, etc [[3]]. A typical 2-of-3 Bitcoin P2SH multisig redeem script (where any 2 of the 3 predefined public keys must sign the transaction) has the following form:

```Text
redeemScript     = <OP_2> <A pubkey> <B pubkey> <C pubkey> <OP_3> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
```

The P2SH payment address is the result of the redeem script double hashed with SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 and then Base58Check encoded with a prefix of `0x05`:

```Text
redeemScriptHash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(redeemScript))
P2SHAddress      = base58check.Encode("05", redeemScriptHash)
```

Multiple payments can now be sent to the P2SH payment address. A generic funding transaction's output script for the P2SH payment address has the following form, irrespective of the redeem script's contents,

```Text
scriptPubKey      =     OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```


with `OP_HASH160` being the combination of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. The 2-of-3 multisig redeem transaction's input script would the have the following form

```Text
scriptSig         =  OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript>
```

and the combined spending and funding transaction script (validation script) would be

```Text
validationScript    = OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript> OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```

When `validationScript` is executed all values are added to the execution stack in sequence. When opcode `OP_HASH160` is encountered the preceding value `<redeemScript>` is hashed and added to the stack and when opcode `OP_EQUAL` is encountered the previous two values, hash of the `<redeemScript>` and `<redeemScriptHash>`, are compared and removed from the stack if equal. The top of the stack then contains `<redeemScript>`, which is evaluated with the two entries on top of that, `<A sig>` and `<C sig>`. The last value in the stack, `OP_0`, is needed for a glitch in the `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` opcode implementation which makes it pop one more item than are available on the stack ([[1]], [[5]]).

*What is signed?*

Partial signatures are created in the same sequence as the public keys are defined in `redeemScript`. A simplified serialized hexadecimal version of the transaction - consisting of the input transaction ID and UTXO index, amount to be paid, `scriptPubKey` and transaction locktime - is signed. Each consecutive partial signature includes a serialization of the previous partial signature with the simplified transaction data to be signed, creating multiple cross-references in the signed data. This, combined with the public keys, proves the transaction was created by the real owners of the bitcoins in question ([[4]], [[5]], [[6]]).

*How is change redirected to the multisig P2SH?*

Bitcoin transactions are allowed to have multiple recipients, and one of the recipients of the funds from a P2SH multisig transaction can be the the original `P2SHAddress`, thus sending change back to itself. Circular payments to the same addresses are allowed, but it will suffer from a lack of confidentiality. Another way to do this would be to create a new `redeemScript` with a new set of public keys every time a P2SH multisig transaction is done to collect the change, but this will be more complex to manage [[4]].



## Formation of the Multiparty Bulletproof UTXO

## Security of the Mimblewimble Blockchain

A [Mimblewimble](../mimblewimble-1/MainReport.md) blockchain relies on two complimenting aspects to provide security; [Pederson Commitments](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments) and range proofs (in the form of [Bulletproof range proofs](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-and-mimblewimble/MainReport.md)). Pederson Commitments provide perfectly hiding and computationally binding commitments, i.e. the confidentiality aspect, and range proofs provide assurance that the currency cannot be inflated and that 3<sup>rd</sup> parties cannot lock away ones funds. Due to the fact that Mimblewimble commitments are totally confidential and that ownership cannot be proofed, anyone can try to spend or mess with unspent coins embedded in those commitments. Fortunately any new UTXO requires a range proof, and this is impossible to create if the input commitment cannot be opened. This is demonstrated below.

Let $ (v_{in} H + k_{in} G) $ be the "closed" input UTXO commitment that someone is trying to lock away by adding an additional blinding factor $ k_{x} $ to the commitment. A valid Mimblewimble transaction would have the following form
$$
\begin{aligned} 
C_{locked}(v_1 , k_1 + k_x) - C_{in}(v_1 , k_1) - C_{fee}(v_2 , k_2) + fee &= (\mathbf{0}) \\\\
(v_1 H + (k_1 + k_x) G) -  (v_1 H + k_1 G) - (v_2 H + k_2 G) + fee &= (\mathbf{0})
\end{aligned}
$$
where the attacker tries to lock away the unspent-hiding-blinding commitment $ (v_1 H + k_1 G) $ and the value of $ (v_2 H + k_2 G) $ is equal to $ fee $ to be paid to the miner. In this example the commitment $ (v_1 H + (k_1 + k_x) G) $ will be equally unspendable by the attacker as well as the owner because neither of them will know the total blinding factor $ k_1 + k_x $. Fortunately, in order to construct a Bulletproof range proof for the new output $ (v_1 H + (k_1 + k_x) G) $, the values of $ v_1 $ and $ k_1 + k_x $ must be known otherwise the prover (i.e. attacker) cannot convince an honest verifier that $ v_1 $ is non-negative (i.e. in the range $ [0,2^n - 1] $).
