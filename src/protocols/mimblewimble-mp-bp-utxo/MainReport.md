## Introduction

In [Mimblewimble](../mimblewimble-1/MainReport.md), the concept of a Bitcoin-type multi-signature (multisig) applied to 
an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) does not really exist. 

In Bitcoin, multisig payments are usually combined with Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) functionality as a means to send funds 
to a P2SH payment address, and then to manage its expenditure from there. The redeem script itself sets the conditions 
that must be fulfilled for the UTXOs linked to the P2SH payment address to be spent ([[1]], [[2]]). 

Unlike Bitcoin, Mimblewimble transactions do not involve payment addresses, as all transactions are confidential. The 
only requirement for a Mimblewimble UTXO to be spent is the ability to open (or unlock) the 
[Pedersen Commitment](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments) 
that contains the tokens; it does not require an "owner" signature. A typical Mimblewimble UTXO looks like this [[9]]:

Another fundamental difference is that for any Mimblewimble transaction, all parties, i.e. all senders and all 
receivers, must interact to conclude the transaction.



## Background



### Bitcoin $ m\text{-of-}n $ Multisig in a Nutshell

Multiple use cases of $ m\text{-of-}n $ multisig applications exist, e.g. a $ 1\text{-of-}2 $ petty cash account, 
a $ 2\text{-of-}2 $ two-factor authentication wallet and a $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ board of directors account [[3]]. 
A typical $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ Bitcoin P2SH multisig redeem script (where any two of the three predefined public keys must sign the 
transaction) has the following form:

```Text
redeemScript     = <OP_2> <A pubkey> <B pubkey> <C pubkey> <OP_3> OP_CHECKMULTISIG
```

The P2SH payment address is the result of the redeem script double hashed with SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 and then 
Base58Check encoded with a prefix of `0x05`:

```Text
redeemScriptHash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(redeemScript))
P2SHAddress      = base58check.Encode("05", redeemScriptHash)
```

Multiple payments can now be sent to the P2SH payment address. A generic funding transaction's output script for the 
P2SH payment address has the following form, irrespective of the redeem script's contents:

```Text
scriptPubKey      =     OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```

with `OP_HASH160` being the combination of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. The $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ multisig redeem transaction's input script 
would have the following form:

```Text
scriptSig         =  OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript>
```

and the combined spending and funding transaction script (validation script) would be

```Text
validationScript    = OP_0 <A sig> <C sig> <redeemScript> OP_HASH160 <redeemScriptHash> OP_EQUAL
```

When `validationScript` is executed, all values are added to the execution stack in sequence. When opcode `OP_HASH160` 
is encountered, the preceding value `<redeemScript>` is hashed and added to the stack; and when opcode `OP_EQUAL` is 
encountered, the previous two values, hash of the `<redeemScript>` and `<redeemScriptHash>`, are compared and removed 
from the stack if equal. The top of the stack then contains `<redeemScript>`, which is evaluated with the two entries on 
top of that, `<A sig>` and `<C sig>`. The last value in the stack, `OP_0`, is needed for a glitch in the `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` 
opcode implementation, which makes it pop one more item than those that are available on the stack ([[1]], [[5]]).

*What is signed?*

Partial signatures are created in the same sequence in which the public keys are defined in `redeemScript`. A simplified 
serialized hexadecimal version of the transaction - consisting of the input transaction ID and UTXO index, amount to be 
paid, `scriptPubKey` and transaction locktime - is signed. Each consecutive partial signature includes a serialization 
of the previous partial signature with the simplified transaction data to be signed, creating multiple cross-references 
in the signed data. This, combined with the public keys, proves the transaction was created by the real owners of the 
bitcoins in question ([[4]], [[5]], [[6]]).

*How is change redirected to the multisig P2SH?*

Bitcoin transactions can have multiple recipients, and one of the recipients of the funds from a P2SH multisig 
transaction can be the original `P2SHAddress`, thus sending change back to itself. Circular payments to the same 
addresses are allowed, but they will suffer from a lack of confidentiality. Another way to do this would be to create a 
new `redeemScript` with a new set of public keys every time a P2SH multisig transaction is done to collect the change, 
but this would be more complex to manage [[4]].



### Security of the Mimblewimble Blockchain

A [Mimblewimble](../mimblewimble-1/MainReport.md) blockchain relies on two complementary aspects to provide security: 
[Pedersen Commitments](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments) 
and range proofs (in the form of [Bulletproof range proofs](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-and-mimblewimble/MainReport.md)). 
Pedersen Commitments, e.g. $ C(v,k) = (vH + kG) $, provide perfectly hiding and computationally binding commitments. 
(Refer to [Appendix A](#appendix-a-notation-used) for all notation used.) 

In Mimblewimble, this means that an adversary, with infinite computing power, can determine alternate pairs 
$ v ^\prime , k ^\prime $ such that $ C(v,k) = C(v ^\prime , k ^\prime) $ in a reasonable time, to open the commitment 
to another value when challenged (computationally binding). However, it will be impossible to determine the specific 
pair $ v, k $ used to create the commitment, because there are multiple pairs that can produce the same $ C $ (perfectly 
hiding).

In addition to range proofs assuring that all values are positive and not too large, strictly in the range 
$ [0,2^{64} - 1] $, it also prohibits third parties locking away one's funds, as demonstrated in the next section. Since 
Mimblewimble commitments are totally confidential and ownership cannot be proved, anyone can try to spend or mess with 
unspent coins embedded in those commitments. Fortunately, any new UTXO requires a range proof, and this is impossible to 
create if the input commitment cannot be opened.



### The importance of Range Proofs

The role that Bulletproof range proofs play in securing the blockchain can be demonstrated as follows. Let 
$ C\_a(v\_1 , k\_1) $ be the "closed" input UTXO commitment from Alice that a bad actor, Bob, is trying to lock away. 
Bob knows that all commitments in a Mimblewimble blockchain are additionally homomorphic. This means that he can 
theoretically use Alice's commitment as input and create a new opposing output in a transaction that sums to a 
commitment of the value $ 0 $, i.e. $ (\mathbf{0}) $. For this opposing output, Bob will attempt to add an additional 
blinding factor $ k\_{x} $ to the commitment in such a way that the miners validating the transactions will not complain. 

A valid Mimblewimble transaction would have the following form:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
C\_\mathrm{locked}(v\_1 , k\_1 + k\_x) - C\_a(v\_1 , k\_1) - C\_b(v\_2 , k\_2) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0}) \\\\
\\\\
(v\_1 H + (k\_1 + k\_x) G) - (v\_1 H + k\_1 G) - (v\_2 H + k\_2 G) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0})
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$

where the unspent-hiding-blinding commitment from Alice is $ (v\_1 H + k\_1 G) $ and the value of $ (v\_2 H + k\_2 G) $ 
is equal to $ \mathrm{fee} \cdot H $ to be paid to the miner. The newly created commitment 
$ (v\_1 H + (k\_1 + k\_x) G) $ would be equally unspendable by Alice and Bob, because neither of them would know the 
total blinding factor $ k\_1 + k\_x $. Fortunately, in order to construct a Bulletproof range proof for the new output 
$ (v\_1 H + (k\_1 + k\_x) G) $ as required by transaction validation rules, the values of $ v\_1 $ and $ k\_1 + k\_x $ 
must be known, otherwise the prover (i.e. Bob) would not be able to convince an honest verifier (i.e. the miner) that 
$ v\_1 $ is non-negative (i.e. in the range $ [0,2^n - 1] $).

If Bob can convince Alice that she must create a fund over which both of them have signing powers ($ 2\text{-of-}2 $ 
multisig), it would theoretically be possible to create the required Bulletproof range proof for relation (1) if they 
work together to create it.



### Secure Sharing Protocol

Multiple parties working together to create a single transaction that involves multiple steps, need to share information 
in such a way that what they shared cannot work against them. Each step requires a proof, and it should not be possible 
to replay an individual step's proof in a different context. Merlin transcripts [[7]] is an excellent example of a 
protocol implementation that achieves this. For the purposes of this report, a simple information sharing protocol 
is proposed that can be implemented with Merlin transcripts [[7]]. 



## Mimblewimble $ n\text{-of-}n $ Multiparty Bulletproof UTXO



### Simple Sharing Protocol

Alice, Bob and Carol agree to set up a multiparty $ 3\text{-of-}3 $ multisig fund that they can control together. They 
decide to use a sharing hash function $ val\_H = \text{H}\_{s}(arg) $ as a handshaking mechanism for all information 
they need to share. The first step is to calculate the hash $ val\_H $ for the value $ arg $ they want to 
commit to in sharing, and to distribute it to all parties. They then wait until all other parties' commitments have been 
received. The second step is to send the actual value they committed to all parties, to then verify each 
value against its commitment. If everything matches up, they proceed; otherwise they stop and discard everything they 
have done. 

This ensures that public values for each step are not exposed until all commitments have been received. They will apply 
this simple sharing protocol to all information they need to share with each other. This will be denoted by 
$ \text{share:} $.



### Setting up the Multiparty Funding Transaction

In the transaction Alice, Bob and Carol want to set up, $ C\_m $ is the multiparty shared commitment that contains the 
funds, and $ C\_a $, $ C\_b $ and $ C\_c $ are their respective input contributions. This transaction looks as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
C\_m(v\_1, \sum \_{j=1}^3 k\_jG) - C\_a(v\_a, k\_a) - C\_b(v\_b, k\_b) - C\_c(v\_c, k\_c) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0}) \\\\
(v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) - (v\_aH + k\_aG) - (v\_bH + k\_bG) - (v\_cH + k\_cG) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0})
\end{aligned}
$$

In order for this scheme to work, they must be able to jointly sign the transaction with a Schnorr signature, while 
keeping their portion of the shared blinding factor secret. Each of them creates their own private blinding factor 
$ k\_n $ for the multiparty shared commitment and shares the public blinding factor $ k\_nG $ with the group:

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace k\_1G, k\_2G, k\_3G \rbrace
$$

They proceed to calculate their own total excess blinding factors as 
$ x\_{sn} = \sum k\_{n(change)} - \sum k\_{n(inputs)} - \phi\_n $, with $ \phi_n\ $ being a random offset of their own 
choosing (in this example there is no change): 

$$
\begin{aligned} 
x\_{sa} &= 0 - k\_a - \phi\_a \\\\
x\_{sb} &= 0 - k\_b - \phi\_b \\\\
x\_{sc} &= 0 - k\_c - \phi\_c
\end{aligned}
$$

The offset $ \phi\_n $ is introduced to prevent someone else linking this transaction's inputs and outputs when 
analyzing the Mimblewimble block, and will be used later on to balance the transaction. They consequently share the 
public value of the excess $ x\_{sn}G $ with each other: 

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace x\_{sa}G, x\_{sb}G, x\_{sc}G \rbrace
$$

They now have enough information to calculate the aggregated public key for the signature:

$$
P\_{agg} = (k\_1G + x\_{sa}G) + (k\_2G + x\_{sb}G) + (k\_3G + x\_{sc}G) \\\\
P\_{agg} = (k\_1G - (k\_a + \phi\_a)G) + (k\_2G - (k\_b + \phi\_b)G) + (k\_3G - (k\_c + \phi\_c)G)
$$

Each party also selects a private nonce $ r\_n $, shares the public value $ r\_nG $ with the group,

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace r\_aG, r\_bG, r\_cG \rbrace
$$

and calculates the aggregated public nonce for the signature:

$$
R\_{agg} = r\_aG + r\_bG + r\_cG
$$

The signature challenge $ e $ can now be calculated:

$$
e = \text{Hash}(R\_{agg} || P\_{agg} || m) \mspace{18mu} \text{ with } \mspace{18mu} m = \mathrm{fee} \cdot H ||height
$$

Each party now uses their private nonce $ r\_n $, secret blinding factor $ k\_n $ and excess $ x\_{sn} $ to calculate a 
partial Schnorr signature $ s\_n $:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
s\_a &= r_a + e \cdot (k\_1 + x\_{sa}) \\\\
s\_b &= r_b + e \cdot (k\_2 + x\_{sb}) \\\\
s\_c &= r_c + e \cdot (k\_3 + x\_{sc})
\end{aligned}
$$

These partial signatures are then shared with the group to be aggregated:

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace s\_a, s\_b, s\_c \rbrace
$$

The aggregated Schnorr signature for the transaction is then simply calculated as

$$
s\_{agg} = s\_a + s\_b + s\_c
$$

The resulting signature for the transaction is the tuple $ (s\_{agg},R\_{agg}) $. To validate the signature, publicly 
shared aggregated values $ R\_{agg} $ and $ P\_{agg} $ will be needed:

$$
s\_{agg}G \overset{?}{=} R\_{agg} + e \cdot P\_{agg}
$$

To validate that no funds are created, the total offset must also be stored in the transaction kernel, so the parties 
also share their offset and calculate the total:

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace \phi\_a, \phi\_b, \phi\_c \rbrace \\\\
\phi\_{tot} = \phi\_a + \phi\_b + \phi\_c
$$

The transaction balance can then be validated to be equal to a commitment to the value $ 0 $ as follows:

$$
(v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) - (v\_aH + k\_aG) - (v\_bH + k\_bG) - (v\_cH + k\_cG) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H \overset{?}{=} 
(0H + ( P\_{agg} + \phi\_{tot})G)
$$



### Creating the Multiparty Bulletproof Range Proof

One crucial aspect in validating the transaction is still missing, i.e. each new UTXO must also include a Bulletproof 
range proof. Up to now, Alice, Bob and Carol could each keep their portion of the shared blinding factor $ k\_n $ 
secret. The new combined commitment they created $ (v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) $ cannot be used as is to calculate 
the Bulletproof range proof, otherwise the three parties would have to give up their portion of the shared blinding 
factor. Now they need to use a secure method to calculate their combined Bulletproof range proof.



#### Utilizing Bulletproofs MPC Protocol

This scheme involves coloring the UTXO to enable attachment of additional proof data, a flag to let the miners know that 
they must employ a different set of validation rules and a hash of the UTXO and all metadata. The 
[Bulletproofs Multiparty Computation](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#mpc-protocol-for-bulletproofs) 
(MPC) protocol can be used in a special way to construct a range proof that can be validated by the miners. Aggregating 
the range proofs using this protocol provides a huge space saving; a single Bulletproof range proof consists of 
672&nbsp;bytes, whereas aggregating 16 only consists of 928&nbsp;bytes [[11]]. For this scheme, the simple information 
sharing protocol will not be adequate; an efficient, robust and secure implementation of the Bulletproof MPC range proof 
such as that done by Dalek Cryptography [[10]] is suggested. 

This scheme works as follows. Alice, Bob and Carol proceed to calculate an aggregated MPC Bulletproof range proof for 
the combined multiparty funds, but with each using their own secret blinding factor in the commitment. They therefore 
construct fake commitments that will be used to calculate fake range proofs as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{Alice's fake commitment:} \mspace{18mu} C\_1(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_1) &= (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_1G) \\\\
\text{Bob's fake commitment:} \mspace{18mu} C\_2(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_2) &= (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_2G) \\\\
\text{Carol's fake commitment:} \mspace{18mu} C\_3(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_3) &= (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_3G)
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that 

$$
\begin{aligned} 
C\_m(v\_1, k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3) &= C\_1(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_1) + C\_2(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_2) + C\_3(\frac{v\_1}3,k\_3) \\\\
(v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) &= (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_1G) + (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_1G) + (\frac{v\_1}3H + k\_1G)
\end{aligned}
$$

and that rounding implementation of $ ^{v\_1} / \_3 $ can ensure that adding these components for all parties will 
produce the original value $ v\_1 $.

Running the Bulletproof MPC range proof will result in a proof share for each party for their fake commitments, which 
will be aggregated by the dealer according to the MPC protocol. Any one of the party members can be the dealer, as the 
objective here is just to create the aggregated range proof. Let the aggregated range proof for the set 
$ \lbrace C\_1, C\_2, C\_3 \rbrace $ be depicted by $ RP\_{agg} $. The UTXO will then consist of the tuple 
$ (C\_m , RP\_{agg}) $ and metadata $ \lbrace flag, C\_1, C\_2, C\_3, hash_{C_{m}} \rbrace $. The hash that will secure 
the metadata is proposed as: 

$$
hash_{C\_m} = \text{Hash}(C\_m || RP\_{agg} || flag || C\_1 || C\_2 || C\_3)
$$

Range proof validation by miners will involve

$$
\begin{aligned} 
hash_{C\_m} &\overset{?}{=} \text{Hash}(C\_m || RP\_{agg} || flag || C\_1 || C\_2 || C\_3) \\\\
C\_m &\overset{?}{=} C\_1 + C\_2 + C\_3 \\\\
\text{verify: } &RP\_{agg} \text{ for set } \lbrace C\_1, C\_2, C\_3 \rbrace 
\end{aligned}
$$

instead of 

$$
\text{verify: } RP\_m \text{ for } C\_m
$$



#### Utilizing Grin's Shared Bulletproof Computation

Grin extended the 
[Inner-product Range Proof](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#inner-product-range-proof) 
implementation to allow for multiple parties to jointly construct a single Bulletproof range proof $ RP\_m $ for a known 
value $ v $, where each party can keep their partial blinding factor secret. The parties must share committed values 
deep within the inner-product range proof protocol ([[12]], [[13]], [[14]]). 

In order to construct the shared Bulletproof range proof $ RP\_m $, each party starts to calculate their own range proof 
for commitment $ C\_m(v\_1, \sum \_{j=1}^3 k\_jG) $ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{Alice:} \mspace{18mu} C\_1(v\_1,k\_1) &= (v\_1H + k\_1G) \\\\
\text{Bob:} \mspace{18mu} C\_2(0,k\_2) &= (0H + k\_2G) \\\\
\text{Carol:} \mspace{18mu} C\_3(0,k\_3) &= (0H + k\_3G)
\end{aligned}
$$

With this implementation, Alice needs to act as the dealer. When they get to [steps (53) to (61) in Figure 5](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#inner-product-range-proof) of the inner-product range proof 
protocol, they introduce the following changes:

1. Each party shares $ T\_{1\_j} $ and $ T\_{2\_j} $ with all other parties.
1. Each party calculates $ T\_1 = \sum\_{j=1}^k T\_{1\_j} $ and $ T_2 = \sum\_{j=1}^k T\_{2\_j} $.
1. Each party calculates $ \tau\_{x\_j} $ based on $ T\_1 $ and $ T\_2 $.
1. Each party shares $ \tau\_{x\_j} $ with the dealer.
1. The dealer calculates $\tau\_x = \sum\_{j=1}^k \tau\_{x\_j} $.
1. The dealer completes the protocol, using their own private $ k\_1 $, where a further blinding factor is required, and 
calculates $ RP\_m $.

Using this approach, the resulting shared commitment for Alice, Bob and Carol is

$$
C\_m(v\_1, \sum \_{j=1}^3 k\_jG) = (v\_1H + \sum \_{j=1}^3 k\_jG) = (v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G)
$$

with the UTXO tuple being $ (C\_m , RP\_m) $. Range proof validation by miners will involve verifying $ RP\_m $ for 
$ C\_m $.

### Spending the Multiparty UTXO

Alice, Bob and Carol had a private bet going that Carol won, and they agree to spend the multiparty UTXO to pay Carol 
her winnings, with the change being used to set up a consecutive multiparty UTXO. This transaction looks as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
C^{'}\_c(v^{'}\_c, k^{'}\_c) + C^{'}_m(v^{'}\_1, \sum \_{j=1}^3 k^{'}\_{j}G) - C_m(v\_1, \sum \_{j=1}^3 k\_jG) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0}) \\\\
(v^{'}\_cH + k^{'}\_cG) + (v^{'}\_1H + (k^{'}\_1 + k^{'}\_2 + k^{'}\_3)G) - (v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H &= (\mathbf{0})
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to the initial transaction, they each create their own private blinding factor $ k^{'}\_n $ for the new 
multiparty UTXO and share the public blinding factor $ k^{'}\_nG $ with the group. Carol also shares the public 
blinding factor $ k^{'}\_cG $ for her winnings:
$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} &\lbrace k^{'}\_1G, k^{'}\_2G, k^{'}\_3G \rbrace \\\\
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} &\lbrace k^{'}\_cG \rbrace
\end{aligned}
$$

As before, they calculate their own total excess blinding factors as 
$ x^{'}\_{sn} = \sum k^{'}\_{n(change)} - \sum k^{'}\_{n(inputs)} - \phi^{'}\_n $: 

$$
\begin{aligned} 
x^{'}\_{sa} &= 0 - k\_1 - \phi^{'}\_a \\\\
x^{'}\_{sb} &= 0 - k\_2 - \phi^{'}\_b \\\\
x^{'}\_{sc} &= 0 - k\_3 - \phi^{'}\_c
\end{aligned}
$$

They share the public value of the excess $ x^{'}\_{sn}G $ with each other: 

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace x^{'}\_{sa}G, x^{'}\_{sb}G, x^{'}\_{sc}G \rbrace
$$

The aggregated public key for the signature can then be calculated as:

$$
P^{'}\_{agg} = (k^{'}\_1G + x^{'}\_{sa}G) + (k^{'}\_2G + x^{'}\_{sb}G) + (k^{'}\_3G + x^{'}\_{sc}G + k^{'}\_cG) \\\\
P^{'}\_{agg} = (k^{'}\_1G - (k\_1 + \phi^{'}\_a)) + (k^{'}\_2G - (k\_2 + \phi^{'}\_a)) + (k^{'}\_3G - (k\_3 + \phi^{'}\_a) + k^{'}\_cG)
$$

Each party again selects a private nonce $ r^{'}\_n $, shares the public value $ r^{'}\_nG $ with the group,

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace r^{'}\_aG, r^{'}\_bG, r^{'}\_cG \rbrace
$$

and calculates the aggregated public nonce for the signature:

$$
R^{'}\_{agg} = r^{'}\_aG + r^{'}\_bG + r^{'}\_cG
$$

The new signature challenge $ e^{'} $ is then calculated as:

$$
e^{'} = \text{Hash}(R^{'}\_{agg} || P^{'}\_{agg} || m) \mspace{18mu} \text{ with } \mspace{18mu} m = \mathrm{fee} \cdot H ||height
$$

Each party now calculates their partial Schnorr signature $ s^{'}\_n $ as before, except that Carol also adds her 
winnings' blinding factor $ k^{'}\_c $ to her signature:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
s^{'}\_a &= r^{'}\_a + e^{'} \cdot (k^{'}\_1 + x^{'}\_{sa})\\\\
s^{'}\_b &= r^{'}\_b + e^{'} \cdot (k^{'}\_2 + x^{'}\_{sa})\\\\
s^{'}\_c &= r^{'}\_c + e^{'} \cdot (k^{'}\_3 + x^{'}\_{sa} + k^{'}\_c)
\end{aligned}
$$

These partial signatures are then shared with the group 

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace s^{'}\_a, s^{'}\_b, s^{'}\_c \rbrace
$$

to enable calculation of the aggregated Schnorr signature as

$$
s^{'}\_{agg} = s^{'}\_a + s^{'}\_b + s^{'}\_c
$$

The resulting signature for the transaction is the tuple $ (s^{'}\_{agg},R^{'}\_{agg}) $. The signature is again 
validated as done previously, using the publicly shared aggregated values $ R^{'}\_{agg} $ and $ P^{'}\_{agg} $:

$$
s^{'}\_{agg}G \overset{?}{=} R^{'}\_{agg} + e^{'} \cdot P^{'}\_{agg}
$$

Again the parties also share their own personal offset so that the total offset can be calculated:

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace \phi^{'}\_a, \phi^{'}\_b, \phi^{'}\_c \rbrace \\\\
\phi^{'}\_{tot} = \phi^{'}\_a + \phi^{'}\_b + \phi^{'}\_c
$$

Lastly, the transaction balance can be validated to be equal to a commitment to the value $ 0 $:

$$
(v^{'}\_cH + k^{'}\_cG) + (v^{'}\_1H + (k^{'}\_1 + k^{'}\_2 + k^{'}\_3)G) - (v\_1H + (k\_1 + k\_2 + k\_3)G) + \mathrm{fee} \cdot H \overset{?}{=} 
(0H + (P^{'}\_{agg} + \phi^{'}\_{tot}G))
$$



## Mimblewimble $ m\text{-of-}n $ Multiparty Bulletproof UTXO

As mentioned in the [Introduction](#introduction), Mimblewimble transactions cannot utilize a smart/redeem script in the 
form of a P2SH, but similar functionality can be implemented in the users' wallets. For the $ m\text{-of-}n $ multiparty 
Bulletproof UTXO, [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme][ssss~] (SSSS) ([[8]], [[15]]) will be used to enable 
$ m\text{-of-}n $ parties to complete a transaction. The SSSS is a method for $ n $ parties to carry one shard (share) 
$ f(i) $ for $ i \in \lbrace 1 , \ldots , n \rbrace $ each of a secret $ s $, such that any $ m $ of them can 
reconstruct the message. The basic idea behind the SSSS is that it is possible to draw an infinite number of polynomials 
of degree $ m $ through $ m $ points, whereas $ m+1 $ points are required to define a unique polynomial of degree $ m $. 
A simplified illustration is shown in Figure&nbsp;1; the SSSS uses polynomials over a finite field, which is not representable on a two-dimensional plane [[19]].

<p align="center"><img src="sources/shamir_simple.png" width="220" /></p>
<div align="center"><b>Figure&nbsp;1: Infinite Number of Polynomials of Degree 2 Possible through 2 Points</b></div>

The shards will be distributed according to [Pedersen’s Verifiable Secret Sharing][pvss~] (VSS) scheme, which extends 
the SSSS, where the dealer commits to the secret $ s $ itself and the coefficients of the sharing polynomial $ f(x) $. 
This is broadcast to all parties, with each receiving a blinding factor shard $ g(i) $ corresponding to their 
secret shard $ f(i) $. This will enable each party to verify that their shard is correct.



### Secret Sharing

Our friends Alice, Bob and Carol decide to set up a $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ scheme, whereby any two of them can authorize a 
spend of their multiparty UTXO. They also want to be able to set up the scheme such that they can perform three rounds 
of spending, with the last round being the closing round. Something they were all thinking about was how to share pieces 
of their blinding factor with each other in a secure and reconstructable fashion. They have heard of Pedersen's VSS scheme 
and decide to use that. 



### Multiple Rounds' Data

The parties will each pre-calculate $ three $ private blinding factors $ k\_{n\text{-}i} $ and shard it according to 
[Pedersen's VSS][pvss~] scheme. The scheme requires $ three $ shard tuples 
$ (k\_{n\text{-}party\text{-}i}, b\_{n\text{-}party\text{-}i}) $ and $ three $ vectors of commitments 
$\mathbf{C}\_{2}( k\_{party\text{-}1})$ for each round. ([Appendix C](#appendix-c-shamirs-secret-sharing-example) 
shows an example of Alice's sharing shards for one private blinding factor.) Whenever a set of information for each 
blinding factor is shared, the parties immediately verify the correctness of the shards they received by following the 
verification step in Pedersen's VVS protocol. They continue to do this until they have all their information set up, 
ready and stored in their wallets.

### How it Works

The three parties set up the initial multiparty [funding transaction](#setting-up-the-multiparty-funding-transaction) 
and [Bulletproof range proof](#creating-the-multiparty-bulletproof-range-proof) exactly the same as they did for the 
$ 3\text{-of-}3 $ case. For this, they use the private blinding factors they pre-calculated for round&nbsp;1. Now, when 
they decide to spend the multiparty UTXO, only two of them need to be present.

Bob and Carol decide to spend funds, exactly [like before](#spending-the-multiparty-utxo), and for this they need to 
reconstruct Alice's private blinding factor for round&nbsp;1 and round&nbsp;2. Because Alice did not win anything, she 
does not need to be present to set up a private blinding factor for an output UTXO the way Carol needs to do. Bob and 
Carol consequently share the shards Alice gave them: 

$$
\text{share:} \mspace{9mu} \lbrace (k\_{1\text{-}b1}, b\_{1\text{-}b1}),  (k\_{1\text{-}c1}, b\_{1\text{-}c1}), 
 (k\_{1\text{-}b2}, b\_{1\text{-}b2}) ,  (k\_{1\text{-}c2}, b\_{1\text{-}c2}) \rbrace
$$

They are now able to reconstruct the blinding factors and verify the commitments to it. If the verification fails, they 
stop the protocol and schedule a meeting with Alice to have a word with her. With all three together, they will be able 
to identify the source of the misinformation.

$$
\text{reconstruct:} \mspace{9mu} (k\_{1\text{-}1}, b\_{1\text{-}1}), (k\_{1\text{-}2}, b\_{1\text{-}2}) \\\\
\text{verify:} \mspace{9mu} C(k\_{1\text{-}1}, b\_{1\text{-}1})\_{shared} \overset{?}{=} (k\_{1\text{-}1}H + b\_{1\text{-}1}G) \\\\
\text{verify:} \mspace{9mu} C(k\_{1\text{-}2}, b\_{1\text{-}2})\_{shared} \overset{?}{=} (k\_{1\text{-}2}H + b\_{1\text{-}2}G)
$$

For this round they choose Bob to play Alice's part when they set up and conclude the transaction. Bob is able to do 
this, because he now has Alice's private blinding factors $ k\_{1\text{-}1} $ and $ k\_{1\text{-}2} $. When constructing 
the signature on Alice's behalf, he chooses a private nonce $ r^{'}\_n $ she does not know, as it will only be used to 
construct the signature and then never again. Bob and Carol conclude the transaction, let Alice know this and inform her 
that a consecutive multi-spend needs to start at round&nbsp;2.

The next time two of our friends want to spend some or all of the remainder of their multiparty UTXO, they will just 
repeat these steps, starting at round&nbsp;2. The only thing that will be different will be the person nominated to play 
the part of the party that is absent; they have to take turns at this.



### Spending Protocol

Alice, Bob and Carol are now seasoned at setting up their $ 2\text{-of-}3 $ scheme and spending the UTXO until all funds 
are depleted. They have come to an agreement on a simple spending protocol, something to help keep all of them honest:

- All parties must always know who shared shards and who played the missing party's role for each round. Therefore, all 
parties must always be included in all sharing communication, even if they are offline. They can then receive those 
messages when they become available again.

- The spend is aborted if any verification step does not complete successfully. To recommence, the parties have to 
cancel all unused shards, calculate new shards for the remainder and start again. For this, all parties need to be 
present.

- No party may play the role of an absent party twice in a row. If Alice is absent, which usually happens, Bob and Carol 
must take turns.



## Conclusions, Observations and Recommendations



### Comparison to Bitcoin

Given the basic differences between Bitcoin and Mimblewimble as mentioned in the [Introduction](#introduction), and the 
multiparty payment scheme introduced here, the following observations can be made:

1. Miner Validation

   In Bitcoin, the P2SH multisig redeem script is validated by miners whenever a multisig payment is invoked. In 
   addition, they also validate the public keys used in the transaction.

   With Mimblewimble multiparty transactions, miners cannot validate who may be part of a multiparty transaction, only 
   that the transaction itself complies with basic Mimblewimble rules and that all Bulletproof range proofs are valid. 
   The onus is on the parties themselves to enforce basic spending protocol validation rules.

1. $ m\text{-of-}n $

   In both Bitcoin and Mimblewimble, $ m\text{-of-}n $ transactions are possible. The difference is in where and how 
   validation rules are applied.

1. Security

   Bitcoin multiparty transactions are more secure due to the validation rules being enforced by the miners.

1. Complexity

   Implementing $ m\text{-of-}n $ multiparty transactions in Mimblewimble will involve wallets to store more data and 
   implement more functionality than when compared to Bitcoin, e.g. Pedersen's VSS scheme.



### General

1. Bulletproof Range Proof

   The choice between using Dalek's Bulletproofs MPC Protocol or Grin's multiparty Bulletproof to construct a multiparty 
   range proof is important. Although using Dalek's method involves more rounds of communication, with a slightly larger 
   proof size and the requirement to have the coins colored, it has definite advantages. It trumps on security while 
   executing the protocol and wallet reconstructability.

1. Practicality

   The Mimblewimble multiparty Bulletproof UTXO as proposed can be practically implemented for both the 
   $ n\text{-of-}n $ and $ m\text{-of-}n $ cases.

1. Information Sharing Protocol

   The [Simple Sharing Protocol](#simple-sharing-protocol) as suggested here may need some more work to make it optimal.
   
1. Generalization

   Although all examples presented here were for three parties, this could easily be generalized.

- **Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme:**<a name="ssss"> </a>A $ (m, n) $ threshold secret sharing scheme is a method for 
$ n $ parties to carry shards/shares of a secret message $ s $ such that any $ m $ of them can reconstruct the message. 
The threshold scheme is perfect if knowledge of $ m − 1 $ or fewer shards provides no information regarding $ s $. 
Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme provides a perfect $ (m, n) $ threshold scheme using Lagrange interpolation 
([[15]], [[17], [[19]]). 

  - Given $ m $ distinct points $ (x\_i, y\_i) $ of the form $ (x\_i, f(x\_i)) $, where $ f(x) $ is a polynomial of 
  degree less than $ m $, then according to the Lagrange interpolation formula $ f(x) $ and $ f(0) $ is determined by

  $$
  f(x) = \sum \_{i=1}^{m} y \_{i} \prod \_{1 \leq j \leq m \atop i \neq j} \frac{x - x \_{j}}{x \_{i} - x \_{j}} \\\\
  f(0) = \sum \_{i=1}^{m} f(i) \prod \_{j \in I \atop j \neq i} \frac{i}{j - i}
  $$

  - Shamir’s scheme is defined for a secret message $ s \in \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} $ with prime $ p $, by setting 
  $ a\_0 = f(0) = s$ for a polynomial $ f(x) $, and choosing the other coefficients $ a\_1, \ldots , a\_{m−1} $ at 
  random in $ \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} $. The trusted party computes $ f(i) $ for all $ 1 \leq i \leq n $, where

  $$
  f(x) = \sum \_{k=0}^{m - 1} a \_{k} x^{k} = a\_0x^0 + a\_1x^1 + a\_2x^2 + \ldots + a\_{m-1}x^{m-1}
  $$

  - The shards $ (i, f(i)) $ are distributed to the $ n $ distinct parties. Since the secret is the constant term 
  $ s = a\_0 = f(0) $, it is recovered from any $ m $ shards $ (i, f(i)) $ for $ I \subset \lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace $ 
  by

  $$
  s = \sum \_{i \in I} f(i) \prod \_{j \in I \atop j \neq i} \frac{i}{j - i}  
  $$

- **Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing:**<a name="pvss"> </a>The Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme is a 
non-interactive $ (m, n) $ threshold VSS scheme that combines 
[Pedersen Commitments](../../cryptography/bulletproofs-protocols/MainReport.md#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments) 
and [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme][ssss~] ([[8]], [[17]], [[18]). This is to ensure the dealer gives consistent shares 
to all parties and that any party can know that the recovered secret is correct.

  - The dealer creates a commitment to the secret $ s $ for a randomly chosen blinding factor $ r $ as 
  $ C\_0(s,r) = (sH + rG) $.

  - The dealer constructs the SSSS sharing polynomial $ f(x) $ as before by setting $ a\_0 = s $, and randomly 
  choosing $ a\_1, \ldots , a\_{m−1} $.

  - The dealer also constructs a blinding factor polynomial $ g(x) $, similar to the SSSS polynomial, by setting 
  $ b\_0 = r $, and randomly choosing $ b\_1, \ldots , b\_{m−1} $. 

  - The dealer constructs commitments to the secret coefficients of $ f(x) $ as $ C\_i(a\_i,b\_i) = (a\_iH + b\_iG) $ 
  for $ i \in \lbrace 1, \ldots, m-1 \rbrace $.

  - The dealer broadcasts the vector of commitments $ \mathbf {C\_{m}} = (C\_0 , \ldots , C\_{m-1}) $ to all parties.

  - The dealer calculates $ (f(i), g(i)) $ from polynomials $ f(x), g(x) $ for $ i \in \lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace $ 
  and distributes the individual shards $ (i, f(i), g(i)) $ to the $ n $ distinct parties.

  - Upon receipt of their shard $ (i, f(i), g(i)) $, each party calculates their own commitment $ (f(i)H + g(i)G) $ and 
  verifies that:

  $$
  (f(i)H + g(i)G) \overset{?}{=} \sum \_{j=0}^{m-1} C\_j \cdot i^j \\\\
  (a\_0i^0 + a\_1i^1 + \ldots + a\_{m-1}i^{m-1})H + (b\_0i^0 + b\_1i^1 + \ldots + b\_{m-1}i^{m-1})G \overset{?}{=} \\\\
  (a\_0H + b\_0G) \cdot i^0 + (a\_1H + b\_1G) \cdot i^1 + \ldots + (a\_{m-1}H + b\_{m-1}G) \cdot i^{m-1} 
  $$

  - The secret $ s $ is recovered as before as per the SSSS from any $ m $ shards.

  - In addition to reconstructing the secret $ s $, the following can be done:

    - Since the blinding factor is the constant term $ r = b\_0 = g(0) $, the blinding factor is recovered from any 
    $ m $ shards $ (i, g(i)) $ for $ I \subset \lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace $ by

    $$
    r = \sum \_{i \in I} g(i) \prod \_{j \in I \atop j \neq i} \frac{i}{j - i}
    $$

    - Since $ C\_0 $ is the first entry in the vector of commitments $ \mathbf {C\_{m}} $, the parties can verify the 
    correctness of the original secret $ s $ that was committed to in the first place when the shards have been shared 
    among the parties as:

    $$
    C\_0(s,r) \overset{?}{=} (sH + rG)
    $$

Using any two of these shards with the tool provided in [[16]], Alice's original private blinding factor can be recreated. Try it out!

**Note:** This example shows blinding factor shards created with the SSSS tool developed by Coleman [[16]]. It was merely developed for demonstration purposes and does not make any claims to meet cryptographic security rules other than using secure randomness.
