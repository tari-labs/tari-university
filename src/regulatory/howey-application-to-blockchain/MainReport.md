# Application of *Howey* to Blockchain Network Token Sales

# Part 1 - Decentralization, Consumptive Purpose and Priming Purchasers’ Expectations, and Efforts of Others



## Background

Many blockchain networks use or intend to use cryptographic tokens (“tokens” or “digital assets”) for various purposes, including as an incentive for network participants to contribute computing power to the network or to gain access to certain goods, services or other network functionality. Some promoters of such a network sell tokens (or the right to receive tokens once the network has launched) and use the sales proceeds to finance development and maintenance of the networks.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has determined that many of the token offerings and sales over the past few years have been in violation of federal securities laws and, in some cases, the SEC has taken action against the promoters of the offerings[^1].

[^1]: Refer to the following Orders: Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order against Munchee Inc. (the “*Munchee* Order”); Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Making Findings, and Imposing Penalties and a Cease-and-Desist Order against CarrierEQ, Inc., D/B/A/ Airfox (the “*Airfox*” Order); Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section&nbsp; 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Making Findings, and Imposing Penalties and a Cease-and-Desist Order against Paragon Coin, Inc. (the “*Paragon* Order”); and Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order against Gladius Network LLC (the “*Gladius* Order”).

In each case, underpinning the SEC’s decision to take action has been its determination that the digital assets that were offered and sold were securities pursuant to Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act” or “Act”)[^2].

[^2]: 15 U.S.C. Section 77a.

Under Section 5 of the Securities Act, it is generally unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to offer or sell a security without complying with the registration requirements of Section 5,  unless the securities offering qualifies for an exemption from registration.

The sanction for a violation of Section 5 can be significant, including a preliminary and permanent injunction, rescission, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil money penalties. It is important that those seeking to promote token offerings and sales do so only after ensuring that the tokens to be sold are not securities under the Securities Act or that the offering, if it involves securities, complies with Section 5 or otherwise qualifies for an exemption from registration thereunder.

While the Securities Act, relevant case law, and administrative proceedings and statements of the SEC and its officials offer guidance on many of the considerations involved in an analysis of whether a given digital asset is a security, the facts and circumstances relating to each token, token offering and sale are typically quite unique. Many who seek to undertake token offerings and sales struggle to achieve clarity regarding whether such offerings and sales must be registered under the Securities Act or have to fit within an exemption from the Act’s registration requirements. As a result, there is significant regulatory uncertainty regarding the offering and sale of tokens.

This report reviews how recent statements by William Hinman, the Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, are indicative of the Commission’s approach to applying the investment contract test to digital assets. This test, laid out in *SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.*, 328 U.S. 293 (1946), is commonly referred to as the “*Howey* test”, which the SEC explicitly adopted in its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017)[^3]

[^3]: Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes the Commission to investigate violations of the federal securities laws and, in its discretion, to "publish information concerning any such violations". The report does not constitute an adjudication of any fact or issue, nor does it make any findings of violations by any individual or entity.

and in subsequent actions[^4].

[^4]: Refer to the *Munchee* Order and the *Airfox* Order for examples.

In particular, this report examines some of the statements Hinman has made relating to the fourth prong of the *Howey* test (i.e. the “efforts of others”) and discusses factors for promoters of token offerings to consider when assessing whether a token purchaser may have a reasonable expectation of earning profits from the significant efforts of others.   It should be noted that this report is in no way intended to constitute, or be relied upon as, legal advice or to substitute for obtaining competent legal advice from an experienced attorney.

## What is a security?

Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act defines a security as follows:

> The term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security”, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.
>

While blockchain network tokens (as well as a wide variety of other instruments) are not explicitly included in the definition of “security” under the Act, courts have abstracted the common elements of an “investment contract”, which is included in the definition of “security” under Section 2(a)(1) (and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act of 1934)[^5]]

[^5]: 15 U.S.C. Section 78a.

, to establish a “flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” *Howey*, 328 U.S. at 299.

Accordingly, a determination of whether an instrument not specifically enumerated under Section 2(a)(1) of the Act may be deemed to be a security that implicates the federal securities laws must include an analysis of whether it is an investment contract under *Howey*.

## What is an Investment Contract? (i.e. the “*Howey* Test”)

*Howey* (and its progeny) established the framework of a four-part test to determine whether an instrument is an investment contract and therefore a security subject to the U.S. federal securities laws. Howey provides that an investment contract exists if there is:

1. an **investment of money**
2. into a **common enterprise**
3. with a **reasonable expectation of profits**
4. derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial **efforts of others**.

For an instrument to be an investment contract, each element of the *Howey* test must be met. Put another way, if any element of the test is not met, the instrument is not an investment contract.

## The Fourth Prong of The *Howey* Test - Efforts of Others

While the “efforts of others” prong of the *Howey* test is, at some level, no more important in an application of *Howey* than any of the other prongs, as a practical matter, it’s frequently the prong on which the most uncertainty hangs. The “efforts of others” is often the focus when it comes to public blockchain networks, because the decentralization of control many such projects seek to foster prompts the following question: does the kind and degree of decentralization that exists mean that any expectation of profits token purchasers may have does not come from the efforts of others for purposes of *Howey**?*  The determination that token purchasers reasonably expected profits to come from the efforts of a centralized (or at least coordinated) person or group has been central in the Commission’s findings that the tokens were securities in each of the recent SEC enforcement actions relating to token offerings and sales[^6].

[^6]: Refer to the example in paragraph 32 in the *Munchee* Order(“MUN token purchasers had a reasonable expectation of profits from their investment in the Munchee enterprise. The proceeds of the MUN token offering were intended to be used by Munchee to build an 'ecosystem' that would create demand for MUN tokens and make MUN tokens more valuable.”); in paragraph 21 in the *Airfox* Order (“AirFox told investors that the company would improve the AirFox App, add new functionality, enter into agreements with third-party telecommunication companies, and take other steps to encourage the use of AirTokens and foster the growth of the ecosystem. Investors reasonably expected they would profit from the success of AirFox’s efforts to grow the ecosystem and the concomitant rise in the value of AirTokens.”) 
## Decentralization, Consumptive Purpose and Priming Purchasers’ Expectations

On June 14, 2018, William Hinman, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, delivered a speech[^7]

[^7]: William Hinman, Director of the Division of Corp. Fin., SEC, Remarks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto: Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic) (14 June 2018).

addressing whether “a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering [can] ever later be sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security, and posed a set of six questions[^8]

[^8]: Hinman also posed a separate set of seven questions exploring “contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security”.

directly related to the application of the “efforts of others” prong of the Howey test to offerings and sales of digital assets. He noted two cases where he believed this was indeed possible:

- “where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in” (e.g. purchases of the digital assets related to a decentralized enterprise or network); or
- “where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created” (e.g. purchases of digital assets for a consumptive purpose).

These two themes (decentralized and consumptive purpose) are present throughout the various questions Hinman posed:

1.	Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?

2.	Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?

3.	Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?

4.	Are purchasers “investing”, that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?

5.	Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?

6.	Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?

Hinman noted these questions as being useful to consider when assessing the facts and circumstances surrounding offerings and sales of digital assets to determine “whether a third party - be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors - drives the expectation of a return". If such a party does drive an expectation of a return on a purchased digital asset, there is a greater likelihood that the asset will be deemed to be an investment contract and therefore a security. The following offers for consideration select implications of this line of questions as industry participants seek a greater understanding of whether or not a digital asset is a security. 

### Decentralization 

Hinman’s questions reinforce that the degree and nature of a promoter’s involvement will have a bearing on the Howey analysis. The facts and circumstances relating to a promoter are key. That said, if a promoter does not play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the network underlying the tokens, it cuts against finding the “efforts of others” prong has been met. A promoter may seek to play a more limited role in the development and maintenance of the network. Or, along similar lines, influence over the development and maintenance of the network may be widely dispersed (i.e. decentralized) among many network stakeholders so that there is no identifiable “person or group” that continues to play a significant role, especially as compared to the role that the dispersed stakeholders play.

The SEC has also focused on a promoter's efforts to use the proceeds from a token offering to create an ecosystem that will drive demand for the tokens once the network is functional[^9].

[^9]:    For an example, refer to *supra* note 6 and the accompanying text.

Further, the SEC has singled out promoter efforts to maintain a token’s price by intervening in the buying and selling of tokens, separate from developing and maintaining the underlying network[^10].

[^10]: For an example, refer to paragraph 27 of the *Paragon* Order (“Paragon also maintained, as part of its core business model outlined in the White Paper, a ‘Controlled Reserve Fund’ to keep the price of PRG ‘stable’. If the price of PRG tokens were to drop significantly, the Controlled Reserve Fund would ‘intervene by buying back PRG in an effort to stabilize the market price’. Conversely, the Controlled Reserve Fund would ‘[r]elease PRG to the markets if PRG deflates too fast and pushes token prices up too rapidly’”); Guillermo Jimenez, SEC's Crypto Czar: Stablecoins might be violating securities laws Decrypt (2019), https://decryptmedia.com/5940/secs-crypto-czar-stablecoins-might-be-violating-securities-laws (accessed March 19, 2019) (quoting the SEC’s Senior Advisor for Digital Assets, Valerie Szczepanik, as having stated “I’ve seen stablecoins that purport to control price through some kind of pricing mechanism… controlled through supply and demand in some way to keep the price within a certain band,” and “[W]here there is one central party controlling the price fluctuation over time, [that] might be getting into the land of securities.”). 

In contrast to the kinds of efforts that meet Howey’s fourth prong, to the extent a token’s value is driven by market forces (i.e. supply and demand conditions), it suggests that the value of the token is attributable to factors other than the promoter’s efforts, assuming the promoter does not put some mechanism in place to manage token supply or demand to maintain a token’s price.

In addition, decentralization of control calls into question whether the application of the Securities Act makes sense to begin with. A main purpose of the Securities Act is to ensure that securities issuers “tell the public the truth about their businesses, the securities they are selling, and the risks involved in investing[^11].”

[^11]: *What We Do*, SEC, https://www.sec.gov/Article/whatwedo.html#intro (last visited 7 March 2018).
Typically, the issuer of a security plays a key role in the success of the enterprise and investors rely on the experience, judgment and skill of the enterprise’s management team and board of directors to drive profits. The Act’s disclosure requirements primarily focus on issuers of securities. A decentralized network where no central person or entity plays a key role, however, challenges both identification of a party who should be subject to the Act’s disclosure obligations and the information expected to be disclosed. Indeed, speaking about Bitcoin, Hinman acknowledged as much, stating he “[does] not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time….  Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.[^12]”

[^12]: For an example, refer to *supra* note 9.
Decentralization ultimately invokes consideration of whether application of the Securities Act truly serves its purpose, as well as the practical realities of how doing so would even work.

### Consumptive Purpose

Token purchasers who plan to use their tokens to access a network’s functionality typically are not speculating that the tokens will increase in value. The finding that a token was offered to potential purchasers in a manner inconsistent with a consumptive purpose has been a factor in several of the SEC’s recent orders[^13].

[^13]: For an example, refer to paragraph 18 of the *Munchee* Order (“[The] marketing did not use the Munchee App or otherwise specifically target current users of the Munchee App to promote how purchasing MUN tokens might let them qualify for higher tiers and bigger payments on future reviews... Instead, Munchee and its agents promoted the MUN token offering in forums aimed at people interested in investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets”); paragraph 16 of the *Airfox* Order (“AirFox primarily aimed its promotional efforts for the initial coin offering at digital token investors rather than anticipated users of AirTokens”).
Accordingly, a promoter may seek to limit the offering and sale of tokens to prospective users of the network. A promoter may also seek to ensure that the marketing and other communication related to the token offer is consistent with consumption being the reason for purchasing tokens both in content and audience. The argument that purchasers are acquiring tokens for consumption may be stronger once the network is functional, so that the tokens can actually be used to purchase goods or access services through the network[^14].
[^14]: For an example, refer to paragraph 7 of the *Airfox* Order. (“The terms of AirFox’s initial coin offering purported to require purchasers to agree that they were buying AirTokens for their utility as a medium of exchange for mobile airtime, and not as an investment or a security. At the time of the ICO, this functionality was not available…  Despite the reference to AirTokens as a medium of exchange, at the time of the ICO, investors purchased AirTokens based upon anticipation that the value of the tokens would rise through AirFox’s future managerial and entrepreneurial efforts.”)

### Priming Purchasers’ Expectations

The Commission has given much attention to whether token purchasers were led to expect that the promoter would make efforts to increase token value[^15].

[^15]: For an example, refer to paragraph 17 of the *Munchee* Order (“In addition, Munchee made public statements or endorsed other people’s public statements that touted the opportunity to profit. For example… Munchee created a public posting on Facebook, linked to a third-party YouTube video, and wrote ‘199% GAINS on MUN token at ICO price! Sign up for PRE-SALE NOW!’ The linked video featured a person who said ‘Today we are going to talk about Munchee. Munchee is a crazy ICO… Pretty much, if you get into it early enough, you’ll probably most likely get a return on it.’  This person… ‘speculate[d]’ that a $1,000 investment could create a $94,000 return.”)
In this respect, in bringing enforcement actions, the SEC has highlighted statements made by promoters that specifically tout the opportunity to profit from purchasing a token. The Commission has also emphasized promotional statements explaining that tokens would be listed on digital asset exchanges for secondary trading[^16].
[^16]: For examples, refer to paragraph 13 of the *Munchee* Order (“In the MUN White Paper, Munchee stated it would work to ensure that MUN holders would be able to sell their MUN tokens on secondary markets, saying that ‘Munchee will ensure that MUN token is available on a number of exchanges in varying jurisdictions to ensure that this is an option for all token-holders’”); and paragraph&nbsp; 22 of the *Gladius* Order (“During and following the offering, Gladius attempted to make GLA
Tokens available for trading on major digital asset trading platforms’”). Secondary trading on exchanges offers token holders an alternative to using the token on the network and, especially when facilitated and highlighted by the promoter, can support investment intent for token purchasers (i.e. buying with an eye on reselling for a profit instead of consuming goods or services on the network).
## Conclusion

Parties seeking to undertake offerings and sales of tokens in compliance with federal securities laws may look to the various actions and statements of the SEC for guidance as to whether the token is a security under the Act. As tokens are not specifically enumerated under the definition of “security”, the analysis hinges on the application of the *Howey* test to determine if the token is an “investment contract” under the Act and therefore a security. Questions posed by Hinman during his speech given on 14 June 2018, relate to the decentralization of the enterprise underlying the tokens, the consumptive purpose of token purchasers, and whether token purchasers were led to have an expectation that the promoter would take efforts to drive token value and offer insight into some of the factors promoters of token offerings may consider when assessing whether a token purchaser may have a reasonable expectation of profits and, if so, whether any such profits will be derived from the entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of others. Many of these issues have been central in the recent SEC orders relating to token offerings and sales, and are indicative of the Commission’s approach to evaluating the offer and sale of digital assets.
