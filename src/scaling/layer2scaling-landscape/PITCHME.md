## What is Layer 2 scaling?

<u>Block chain problem to solve:</u> 

- Average block creation time
- Block size limit
- Number of newer blocks needed to confirm a transaction 

![waiting](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/waiting.png)

+++

## What is Layer 2 scaling? (cont'd)

Let's postulate block chain and cryptocurrency "takes over the world", ~433.1 billion non-cash transactions per year...

- 13,734 transactions per second (tx/s) on average!

- Segwit enabled Bitcoin 'like' block chains, need ~644 parallel versions, combined growth ~210 GB per day! 
- Ethereum 'like' block chains, need ~541 parallel versions, combined growth  ~120 GB per day!

This is why we need a proper scaling solution

+++

## What is Layer 2 scaling? (cont'd)

<u>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model</u> 

This is where the term 'Layer 2' is borrowed from

![OSI_Model](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/OSI_Model.png)

+++

## What is Layer 2 scaling? (cont'd)

<u>Layer 2 scaling</u>

- In block chain, decentralized Layer 2 protocols (i.e. Layer 2 scaling) refers to transaction throughput scaling solutions
- Run on top of the main block chain (off-chain), while preserving the attributes of the main block chain (e.g. crypto economic consensus)

![layer2scaling](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/layer2scaling.png)

---

## How will this be applicable to Tari?

- Tari is a high-throughput protocol that will need to handle real world transaction volumes
- Big Neon, the initial business application to be built on top of the Tari block chain
  - High volume transactions when tickets sales open and when tickets will be redeemed
  - Imagine an 85,000 seat stadium with 72 entrance queues on match days... 
  - Serialized real world scanning: 500 tickets in 4 minutes, or ~2 spectators per second per queue
- This will be impossible to do with parent block chain scaling solutions

---

## Layer 2 scaling current initiatives

#### Micropayment Channels

- Users can make multiple transactions without committing all to the block chain
- Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC) allow payments to be securely routed across multiple payment channels
- It is a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of a block chain

<u>Example:</u> The Lightning Network

![lightningnetwork](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/bitcoin-lightning-network-basic.png)

- Currently channels are only bilateral

#####  
#####  
##### Opportunities for Tari

Less than expected as Tari's ticketing use case requires many fast transactions with many parties, not many fast 
transactions with a single party

#####  
#####  
##### Threats to Tari

None

---

#### State Channels

State channels the more general form of micropayment channels (also used for any arbitrary “state update” on block chain) 
like changes inside smart contract.

<u>Consensus</u>: Change of state within channel needs explicit cryptographic consent. Use digitally signed and 
hash-locked transfers as consensus mechanism (balance proofs) secured by time-out (HTLC).

  share commitments to the multisig wallet 
  - All parties act as though it has been deployed, even though it hasn't 

+++

#### State Channels (cont'd)

- - Makes use of global registry, an on-chain contract that maps unique deterministic addresses for any counterfactual 
contract to actual on-chain deployed addresses

  - Decentralized gambling platform, centralized server based random number generation 
  - Investigating threshold cryptography like Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) signature schemes to enable secure random number 
  generation by a group of participants

#### Masternodes

- A masternode is a server on a decentralized network, features like direct send/instant transactions or private transactions
- Masternode operators rewarded by earning portions of block rewards, standard return on their stakes & portion of the 
transaction fees - allowing for a greater ROI

#### Plasma

##### What is it?

- Plasma is a framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts, scalable to a significant amount of 
state updates per second, enabling the root block chain to be able to represent a significant amount of dApps, each 
employing its own block chain in a tree format

![Plasma-example-01](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/Plasma-example-01.png)

- Plasma relies on two key parts: MapReduce functions, and an optional method to do Proof-of-Stake token bonding on top of existing block chains

+++

#### Plasma (cont'd)

- Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding or other Byzantine behaviour

- MapReduce: commitments on block chain computations as input in map phase, merkleized proof of state transition in 
reduce step when returning the result

![Plasma-example](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/Plasma-example.png)

+++

#### Plasma (cont'd)

##### Who?

- *Loom Network*, using Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus and validation, enabling scalable Application Specific 
Side Chains (DAppChains), running on top of Ethereum

- *OMG Network (OmiseGO)*, using Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and validation, a Plasma block chain scaling solution 
for finance running on top of Ethereum

+++

#### Plasma (cont'd)

##### Strengths

- Participants do not need record of entry on parent block chain to enable their participation in a Plasma block chain
- Minimal data needed on parent block chain to confirm transactions when constructing Plasma block chains in tree format
- Private block chain networks can be constructed, enforced by the root block chain (transactions may occur on local 
private block chain and have financial activity bonded by a public parent block chain)

#####  
#####  
##### Weaknesses

Must still be proven on other networks apart from Ethereum

+++

#### Plasma (cont'd)

##### Opportunities for Tari

- Has opportunities for Tari as a L2 scaling solution
- *Possibility to create a Tari ticketing Plasma dAppChain running of Monero without creating a Tari specific root 
block chain?* [**Note:** This will make the Tari block chain dependent on another block chain.]

#####  
#####  
##### Threats for Tari

The Loom Network's SDK makes it extremely easy for anyone to create a new Plasma block chain. In less than a year a 
number of successful and diverse dAppChains have launched. *The next one can easily be for ticket sales...*

- can be used to test or implement new features without risk
- Chains-as-a-Service (CaaS), with data storage 2WP secondary block chains
- Make it easier to implement smart contracts
- Can support larger block sizes and more Txs per second

<u>Weaknesses</u>

- Transferring BTC back into the main Bitcoin block chain is not secure
- Hugely dependent on merged mining, thus 51% attacks are a real threat
- DMMS provided by mining not secure for small systems, while trust of federation/notaries riskier for large systems

<u>Opportunities for Tari</u>

None, if enough functionality will be built into the main Tari block chain

---

#### Scriptless scripts

- *Scriptless Scripts* was coined and invented by mathematician Andrew Poelstra 
- Scripting functionality is offered without actual scripts on the block chain to implement smart contracts
- Currently only work on Mimblewimble and makes use of specific Schnorr signature scheme
- Signature aggregation, mathematically combining several signatures into a single signature, without having to prove 
Knowledge of Secret Keys (KOSK)
- Known as the *plain public-key model* where only requirement is that each potential signer has public key
- KOSK requires users prove possession of secret key during public key registration with certification authority, one 
way to generically prevent rogue-key attacks

+++

#### Scriptless scripts (cont'd)

- Signature aggregation properties sought here (different to normal multi-signature scheme):
  - Must be provably secure in the *plain public-key model*
  - Must satisfy normal Schnorr equation, resulting signature written as function of combination of  public keys
  - Must allow for Interactive Aggregate Signatures (IAS) where signers are required to cooperate
  - Must allow for Non-interactive Aggregate Signatures (NAS) where aggregation can be done by anyone
  - Must allow each signer to sign the same message
  - Must allow each signer to sign their own message

+++

#### Scriptless scripts (cont'd)

<u>User Story...</u>

Alice and Bob each needs to provide half a Schnorr signature for a Tx whereby Alice promises to reveal a secret to Bob 
in exchange for 1 crypto coin. 

Alice can calculate the difference between her half Schnorr signature and the Schnorr signature of the secret (adaptor 
signature) and hand it over to Bob. Bob then has the ability to verify the correctness of the adaptor signature without 
knowing the original signatures. Bob can then provide his half Schnorr signature to Alice so she can broadcast the full 
Schnorr signature to claim the crypto coin. 

By broadcasting the full Schnorr signature Bob has access to Alice's half Schnorr signature and he can then calculate 
the Schnorr signature of the secret because he already knows the adaptor signature, thereby claiming his prize. This is 
also known as *Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments*.

+++

#### Scriptless scripts (cont'd)

<u>Who does it?</u>

[grin-tech.org](https://grin-tech.org/)

Mimblewimble is being sited by Andrew Poelstra as being the ultimate *Scriptless Script*.

![Mimblewimble](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/Mimblewimble.png)

+++

#### Scriptless scripts (cont'd)

<u>Strengths</u>

- <u>Data savings:</u> Signature aggregation provides data compression on block chain
- <u>Privacy:</u> Nothing about Scriptless Script smart contract, other than the settlement Tx, is ever recorded on the 
block chain
- <u>Multiplicity:</u> Multiple digital assets can be transferred between two parties in a single settlement Tx
- <u>Implicit scalability:</u> Scalability on the block chain is achieved by virtue of compressing multiple Txs into a 
single settlement Tx

+++

#### Scriptless scripts (cont'd)

<u>Weaknesses</u>

- Naive implementation of Schnorr multi-signatures that satisfies key aggregation is not secure
- Bellare and Neven (BN) Schnorr signature scheme loses the key aggregation property in order to gain security in the 
plain public-key model
- New Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme MuSig, provably secure in the *plain public-key model*, interactive signature 
aggregation where each signer signs their own message must still be proven by complete security analysis

<u>Opportunities for Tari</u>

- Tari should implement Mimblewimble, *Scriptless Script*s and the MuSig Schnorr signature scheme
- Mimblewimble *Scriptless Script*s could be combined with a federated node (or masternode), similar to that being 
developed by Counterparty, but with improved consensus

---

#### DAG Derivative Protocols

- A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles

- A directed graph is acyclic if it has a topological ordering: for every directed edge *uv* from vertex *u* to 
vertex *v*, *u* comes before *v* in the ordering

  - All conflicting blocks earn their respective miners a block reward *[not in Braiding]*

![SPECTRE](https://github.com/tari-labs/tari-university/raw/master/src/scaling/layer2scaling-landscape/sources/SPECTRE.png)

+++

#### DAG Derivative Protocols (cont'd)

#### DAG Derivative Protocols (cont'd)

<u>Strengths</u>

- **Layer 1 scaling:** Increased Tx throughput on the main block chain
- **Fairness:** Better payoff for weak miners
- **Decentralization mitigation:** Weaker miners also get profits
- **Tx confirmation times:** Confirmation times of several seconds (SPECTRE)
- **Smart contracts:** Support smart contracts (PHANTOM)

<u>Weaknesses</u>

- Still not proven 100%, development continuing
- DAG derivative protocols differ on important aspects like miner payment schemes, security models, support for smart 
contracts, confirmation times, etc.
- All DAG derivative protocols are not created equal, beware!

+++

#### DAG Derivative Protocols (cont'd)

<u>Opportunities for Tari</u>

- Applying the basic DAG principles to make a 51% attack harder by virtue of fairness and miner decentralization resistance.
- Choosing the correct DAG derivative protocol can also significantly improve Layer 1 scaling

---

## Observations

Further investigation into the more promising layer 2 scaling solutions and technologies is required to verify alignment, 
applicability and use-ability

Although not all technologies covered here are Layer 2 Scaling solutions, the strengths should be considered as building 
blocks for the Tari protocol
