# Network Analysis

## Purpose

As networks evolve with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes, processing delays and data transfers etc. may 
arise as issues, potentially creating an environment for adversarial attacks. Network models of a networked ecosystem 
and analysis of such need to be developed to capture the evolution and dynamics.

## Definitions

- From **Lexico**: The mathematical analysis of complex working procedures in terms of a network of related activities [[1]].
- From **Wikipedia**:  Network Analysis is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of *nodes* (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the *ties*, *edges*, or *links* (relationships or interactions) that connect them.[[3]]
