## Summary of Findings

Here is a table highlighting characteristics of the above mentioned BFT Protocols. Asymptotic Security, Permissionless Blockchain, Timing Assumptions, Decentralized Control, Low Latency and Flexible Trust form part of the value system. 

- Asymptotic Security: This depends only on digital signatures (and hash functions) for security
- Permissionless Protocol: This allows anybody to create an address and begin interacting with the protocol.
- Timing Assumptions: Please see [Many Forms of Timing Assumptions (Degrees of Synchrony)](./Appendix.md#many-forms-of-timing-assumptions-degrees-of-synchrony)
- Decentralized Control: Consensus is achieved and defended by protecting the identity of that node until their job is done, through a leaderless nodes. 
- Low Latency: This describes a computer network that is optimized to process a very high volume of data messages with minimal delay.
Flexible Trust: Where users have the freedom to trust any combinations of parties they see fit.

Important characteristics of each protocol are summarized in the table below.

BFT consensus protocols have been considered as a means to diseminate and validate information, can schnorr multisignatures perform the same function in validating information through the action of signing. This will form part of the next review.
