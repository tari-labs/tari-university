# Consensus Mechanisms

## Purpose

Consensus mechanisms "are crucial for a blockchain in order to function correctly. They make sure everyone uses the same 
blockchain" [[1]].

## Definitions

- From **Investopedia**: A 
  consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the 
  necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent 
  systems [[2]].

- From **KPMG**: 
  Consensus mechanism - A method of authenticating and validating a value or transaction on a Blockchain or a distributed 
  ledger without the need to trust or rely on a central authority. Consensus mechanisms are central to the functioning of 
  any blockchain or distributed ledger [[3]].
