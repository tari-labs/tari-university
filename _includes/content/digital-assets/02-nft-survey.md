This survey was completed in 2018 and is a snapshot of the digital asset space at that time. 

It completely preceded the NFT boom of 2021 and therefore the content may seem somewhat quaint when viewed through a 
post-NFT boom lens. Nevertheless, the content is presented here for posterity since it does provide some good basic 
information about the types of digital asset contracts that were nascent in 2018 and which are commonplace today.
          
Interestingly, ERC-875, mentioned here, never gained much traction, and has been superseded by ERC-1155, which is a 
multi-token standard that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
