This presentation contains somewhat outdated content. Whilst the description here follows the original Mimblewimble
paper pretty closely, it no longer precisely describes how Mimblewimble transactions are implemented in say, Grin or
Tari.

The presentation is left here as is since it offers a pretty gentle introduction to the math involved, and it may be
instructive to see how things used to be before you head off to read <a href="/protocols/mimblewimble-transactions-explained">a more detailed and
up-to-date account</a>.
