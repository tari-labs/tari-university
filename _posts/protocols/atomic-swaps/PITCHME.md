## Introduction

- Currency swap
- Centralized exchanged
- Security risks
  - To date : $1.9 Billion 
  - This year: $800 Million

## What are Atomic swaps

- Decentralized exchange

- Allow the exchange of currencies in a trustless environment
- If one party defaults or fails, the transaction is not completed and neither party can "run off" with the other party's money

---

## Hashed Timelock Contracts

- Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) is one of the most important technologies required for atomic swaps. 
- This is a payment class that uses hashlocks and timelocks to require certain public knowledge before doing a payment, otherwise the payment is reversed. 
- HTLCs are also crucial in the lighting network.

## Atomic vs Etomic

- For an atomic swap transaction to happen, both cryptocurrencies must use the same hashing function as this is crucial for HTLC to function. 
- Etomic swaps was created in an attempt to make atomic swaps happen between Bitcoin tokens and Ethereum based tokens (ERC20).

## Observations

Atomic swaps could make it very easy for the user to obtain Tari tokens. 

In the current stance of things BarterDEX looks like the most complete atomic Swap Implementation.
