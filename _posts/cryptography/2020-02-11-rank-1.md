## Introduction

This report explains the technical underpinnings of Rank-1 Constraint Systems (R1CSs) as applied
to Bulletproofs.

The literature on the use of R1CSs in zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, for example in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive
ARguments of Knowledge (zk&#8209;SNARKs), shows that this mathematical tool is used simply as one part of many in
a complex process towards achieving the proof [[1]]. Not much attention is given to it, not even in explaining
what "rank-1" actually means. Although the terminology is similar to the traditional _rank of a matrix_ in
linear algebra, examples on the Internet do not yield a _reduced matrix with only one non-zero row or column_.

R1CSs became more prominent for Bulletproofs due to research work done by Cathie Yun and her colleagues at Interstellar.
The constraint
system, in particular R1CS, is used as an add-on to Bulletproof protocols. The title of
Yun's article, "Building on Bulletproofs"
[[2]], suggests this is true. One of the Interstellar team's goals is to use the constraint system in their
Confidential Asset Protocol called the Cloak and in their envisaged Spacesuit.
Despite their work on using R1CS being research in progress, their detailed notes on constraint systems and their
implementation in RUST are available in [[3]].

The aim of this report is to:

- highlight the connection between arithmetic circuits and R1CSs;
- clarify the difference R1CSs make in Bulletproofs and in range proofs;
- compare ZK proofs for arithmetic circuits and programmable constraint systems.


## Arithmetic Circuits

### Overview

Many problems in _Symbolic Computation_<sup>[def][sc~]</sup> and cryptography can be expressed as the task of computing
some polynomials. Arithmetic circuits are the most standard model for studying the complexity of such computations.
ZK proofs form a core building block of many cryptographic protocols. Of special interest are ZK proof systems capable
of proving the correct computation of arbitrary arithmetic circuits ([[6]], [[7]]).


### Definition of Arithmetic Circuit

An arithmetic circuit $\mathcal{A}$ over the field<sup>[def][fd~]</sup> $\mathcal{F}$ and the set of variables
$X = \lbrace {x_1,\dots,x_n} \rbrace$ is a directed acyclic graph such that the vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ are called
_gates_, while the edges are called _wires_ [[7]]:

- A gate is of in-degree $l$ if it has $l$ incoming wires, and similarly, of out-degree $k$ if
 it has $k$ outgoing wires.
- Every gate in $\mathcal{A}$ of in-degree 0 is labeled with either a variable ${x_i}$ or some field
 element from $\mathcal{F}$. Such a gate is called an input gate. Every gate of out-degree 0 is called an
 output gate or the root.
- Every other gate in $\mathcal{A}$ is labeled with either $\otimes$ or $\oplus$, and called a
 multiplication gate or addition gate, respectively.
- An arithmetic circuit is called a formula if it is a directed tree whose edges are directed from the leaves
 to the root.
- The depth of a node is the number of edges in the longest directed path between the node and the root.
- The size of $\mathcal{A}$, denoted $|\mathcal{A}|$, is the number of wires, i.e. edges, in $\mathcal{A}$.

Arithmetic circuits of interest and most applicable to this report are those with gates of in-degree 2 and out-degree 1.
A typical multiplication gate has a left input $a_L$, a right input $a_R$ and
an output $a_O$ (shown in Figure&nbsp;1). Note that $ a_L \cdot a_R - a_O = 0 $.


<p align="center"><img src="/images/cryptography/r1cs-bulletproofs/basic-multiplication-gate.png" width="170" /></p>
<div align="center"><b>Figure 1: Typical Multiplication Gate</b></div>

In cases where the inputs and outputs are all vectors of size
$n$, i.e.
$\mathbf{a\_L} = ( a\_{L, 1}, a\_{L, 2}, \dots, a\_{L, n})$,
$\mathbf{a\_R} = ( a\_{R, 1}, a\_{R, 2}, \dots, a\_{R, n})$
and
$\mathbf{a_O} = ( a\_{O, 1}, a\_{O, 2}, \dots, a\_{O, n})$,
then multiplication of
$ \mathbf{a\_L} $
and
$ \mathbf{a\_R} $
is defined as an entry-wise
product called the **Hadamard product**:

$$
\mathbf{a_L}\circ \mathbf{a_R} = \big(( a_{L, 1} \cdot a_{R, 1} ), ( a_{L, 2} \cdot a_{R, 2} ), \dots, ( a_{L, n} \cdot
a_{R, n} ) \big) = \mathbf{a_O}
$$

The equation ${ \mathbf{a\_L}\circ \mathbf{a\_R} = \mathbf{a\_O} }$
is referred to as a multiplicative constraint,
but is also known as the Hadamard relation [[4]].


### Example of Arithmetic Circuit

An arithmetic circuit computes a polynomial in a natural way, as shown in this example. Consider the following
arithmetic circuit $\mathcal{A}$ with inputs $\lbrace x_1, x_2, 1 \rbrace$ over some field $\mathcal{F}​$:


<p align="center"><img src="/images/cryptography/r1cs-bulletproofs/polynomial-eg-ac.png" width="400" /></p>
<div align="center"><b>Figure 2: Arithmetic Circuit</b></div>


The output of $\mathcal{A}​$ above is the polynomial $x^2\_1 \cdot x\_2 + x\_1 + 1 ​$ of total degree three. A typical
computational problem would involve finding the solution to, let's say, $x^2\_1 \cdot x\_2 + x\_1 + 1 = 22​$. Or, in a
proof of knowledge scenario, the prover has to prove to the verifier that they have the correct solution to such an
equation. Following the wires in the example shows that an arithmetic circuit actually breaks down the given computation
into smaller equations corresponding to each gate:

$$
u = x_1 \cdot x_1 \text{,} \ \  v = u \cdot x_2 \text{,} \ \ y = x_1 + 1 \ \text {and} \ z = v + y
$$

The variables $u, v​$ and $ y ​$ are called auxiliary variables or low-level variables, while
${ z }​$ is the output of $ \mathcal{A} ​$. Thus, in addition to computing polynomials naturally, an
arithmetic circuit helps in reducing a computation to a low-level language involving only two variables,
one operation and an output.

ZK proofs in general require that statements to be proved are expressed in their
simplest terms for efficiency. A ZK proof's end-to-end journey is to create a _function_
to write proofs about, yet such a function needs to work with specific constructs.
In making ZK proofs more efficient: "these functions have to be specified as sequences of very simple terms,
namely, additions and multiplications of only two terms in a particular field" [[8]]. This is where arithmetic circuits
come in.

In verifying a ZK proof, the verifier needs to carry out a step-by-step check of the computations. When these
computations are expressed in terms of arithmetic circuits, the process translates to checking
whether the output $ a_O $ of each gate is correct with respect to the given inputs
$ a_L $ and $ a_R $. That is, testing if $ a_L \cdot a_R - a_O = 0 $ for each multiplication
gate.


## Rank-1 Constraint Systems

### Overview

Although a computational problem is typically expressed in terms of a high-level programming language, a ZK proof
requires
it to be expressed in terms of a set of quadratic constraints, which are closely related to circuits of logical gates.

Other than in Bulletproof constructions, R1CS types of constraint systems have been featured in several
constructions of zk&#8209;SNARKs. At times they were simply referred to as quadratic constraints or quadratic equations;
refer to
[[6]], [[9]] and [[10]].


### Definition of Constraint System

A constraint system was originally defined by Bootle et al. in [[5]], who first expressed arithmetic circuit
satisfiability in terms of the Hadamard relation and linear constraints:

$$
\mathbf{W_L\cdot { a_L} + W_R\cdot { a_R} + W_O\cdot { a_O } = c }
$$

where $\mathbf{c}​$ is a vector of constant terms used in linear constraints, and $\mathbf{W_L, W_R}​$ and $\mathbf{W_O}​$
are weights applied to respective input vectors and output vectors. Bunz et al. [[4]] incorporated a vector $\mathbf{v}​$ and
vector of weights $\mathbf{W_V}​$ into the Bootle et al. definition:
$$
\mathbf{W_L\cdot { a_L} + W_R\cdot { a_R} + W_O\cdot { a_O } = W_V\cdot { v + c} }
$$

where $\mathbf{v} = {(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_m )}$ is a secret vector of openings ${v_i}$ of the
[Pedersen Commitments](/cryptography/the-bulletproof-protocols#pedersen-commitments-and-elliptic-curve-pedersen-commitments)
$V_i$, $ i \in (1, 2, \cdots, m) $ and
$\mathbf{W_V}$ is a vector of weights for all commitments $V_i$. This incorporation of the secret vector $\mathbf{v}$
and the corresponding vector of weights $\mathbf{W_V}​$ into the linear consistency constraints enabled them to provide a
protocol for a more general setting [[4], page 24].

The Dalek team give a more general definition of a constraint system [[3]]. A **constraint system** is a collection of
arithmetic constraints over a set of variables. There are two kinds of
variables in the constraint system:

- ${m}$ **high-level** variables, the input secrets ${ \mathbf{v}}$;
- $ n$ **low-level** variables, the internal input vectors ${ \mathbf{a}_L}$ and
 ${ \mathbf{a}_R},$ and output vectors ${ \mathbf{a}_O } $ of the multiplication gates.

Specifically, an R1CS is a system that consists of two sets of constraints [[3]]:

- ${ n}$ multiplicative constraints, $ \mathbf{ a_L \circ a_R = a_O } $; and
- ${ q}$ linear constraints, $\mathbf{W_L\cdot { a_L} + W_R\cdot { a_R} + W_O\cdot { a_O } = W_V\cdot { v + c} } $.


### R1CS Definition of zk&#8209;SNARKs

Arithmetic circuits and R1CS are more naturally applied to zk&#8209;SNARKs, and these are implemented in
cryptocurrencies such as Zerocoin and Zcash; refer to [[1]].
To illustrate the simplicity of this concept, a definition (from [[11]]) of an R1CS as it applies to zk&#8209;SNARKs is
provided in this paragraph.

An R1CS is a sequence of groups of three vectors ${ \bf{a_L}}, { \bf{a_R}}, { \bf{a_O}},$ and the
solution to an R1CS is a vector ${ \bf{s}}$ that satisfies the equation:

$$
{ \langle {\mathbf{a_L}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle \cdot \langle {\mathbf{a_R}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle - \langle {\mathbf{a_O}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle = 0 }
$$

where

$$
\langle {\mathbf{a_L}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle = a_{L, 1} \cdot s_1 + a_{L, 2} \cdot s_2 + \cdots + a_{L, n} \cdot s_n ​
$$

which is the inner product of the vectors
$ \mathbf{a\_{L}} = (a\_{L,1}, a\_{L,2}, ..., a\_{L,n} )​$
and
$ {\mathbf{s}} = (s\_1, s\_2, ..., s\_n) ​$.


### Example of Rank-1 Constraint System

One solution to the equation ${x^2_1 x_2 + x_1 + 1 = 22}$, from the preceding example of an arithmetic circuit, is
${ x_1 = 3}$
and ${ { x_2 = 2 }}$ belonging to the appropriate field ${ \mathcal{F}}$. Thus the solution vector
${ { s = ( const, x_1, x_2, z, u, v, y )}}$ becomes ${ { s = ( 1, 3, 2, 22, 9, 18, 4 )}}$.

It is easy to check that the R1CS for the computation problem in the preceding example is as follows (one need only test
if ${ \langle {\mathbf{a_L}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle \cdot \langle {\mathbf{a_R}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle - \langle {\mathbf{a_O}, \mathbf{s}} \rangle = 0}​$
for each equation).


<div align="center"><b>Table 1: Equations and Rank-1 Constraint System Vectors</b></div>


| Equation                       | Rank-1 Constraint System Vectors                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ${ u = x_1\cdot x_1}$          | $ {\bf{a_L}} = ( 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ), \ \ {\bf{a_R}} = ( 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0  ),\ \ {\bf{a_O}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0  ) $ |
| $ { v = u\cdot x_2 }$          | $ {\bf{a_L}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ),\ \ {\bf{a_R}} = ( 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0  ),\ \ {\bf{a_O}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0 )  $ |
| $ { y = 1\cdot( x_1 + 1 ) } $ | ${\bf{a_L}} = ( 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ),\ \ {\bf{a_R}} = ( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ),\ \ {\bf{a_O}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ) $ |
| $ { z = 1\cdot( v + y )} $    | ${\bf{a_L}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 ),\ \ {\bf{a_R}} = ( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ),\ \ {\bf{a_O}} = ( 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 )$ |


In a more formal definition, an **R1CS** is a set of three matrices ${\bf{ A_L, A_R }}$ and ${\bf A_O}$,
where the rows of each matrix are formed by the corresponding vectors $ {\bf{a_L }}$, ${ \bf{a_R }}$ and
${ \bf{a_O}} $, respectively, as shown in Table 1:

$$
\bf{A_L} = \bf{\begin{bmatrix} 0&1&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&1&0&0 \\\\ 1&1&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1&1 \end{bmatrix}} \text{,} \quad
\bf{A_R} = \bf{\begin{bmatrix} 0&1&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&1&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 1&0&0&0&0&0&0 \\\\ 1&0&0&0&0&0&0 \end{bmatrix}} \text{,} \quad
\bf{A_O} = \bf{\begin{bmatrix} 0&0&0&0&1&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1 \\\\ 0&0&0&1&0&0&0 \end{bmatrix}}
$$

Observe that ${ \bf{ (A_L * s^T) \cdot (A_R * s^T ) - (A_O * s^T)} = 0 }$, where "$ * $" is
_matrix multiplication_ and ${ \bf s^T}$ is the transpose of the solution vector ${ \bf{s}}$ [[8]].


## From Arithmetic Circuits to Programmable Constraint Systems for Bulletproofs

Interstellar's "Programmable Constraint Systems for Bulletproofs" [[12]]
is an extension of "Efficient Zero-knowledge Arguments for Arithmetic Circuits in the Discrete
Log Setting" by Bootle et al. [[5]], enabling protocols that
support proving of arbitrary statements in ZK using constraint systems. Although the focus here is on the
two works of research [[5]] and [[12]], the Bulletproofs paper by Bunz et al. [[4]] is here recognized as a bridge
between the two. Table 2 compares these three research documents.

All these ZK proofs are based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.

Interstellar is building an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows developers to choose their own
collection of gadgets suitable for the protocol they wish to develop, as discussed in the
[next section](#interstellars-bulletproof-constraint-system).


## Interstellar's Bulletproof Constraint System

### Overview

The Interstellar team paved the way for the implementation of several cryptographic primitives in the RUST language,
including _Ristretto_ [[14]], a construction
of a prime-order group using a cofactor-8 curve known as Curve25519. They reported on how they implemented Bulletproofs
in Henry de Valence's article, "Bulletproofs Pre-release" [[15]].
An update on their progress in extending the implementation of Bulletproofs [[16]]
to a constraint system API, which enables ZK proofs of arbitrary statements, was given in Cathie Yun's
article, "Programmable Constraint Systems for Bulletproofs"
[[12]]. The Hadamard relation and linear constraints together
form the constraint system as formalized by the Interstellar team. Most of the mathematical background of these
constraints and bulletproofs is contained in Bunz et al.'s paper [[4]].

Dalek's constraint system, as defined earlier in [Definition of Constraint System](#definition-of-constraint-system), is
a collection of two types of arithmetic constraints: multiplicative constraints and linear constraints, over a set of
high-level and low-level variables.


### Easy-to-build Constraint Systems

In this Bulletproofs framework, a prover can build a constraint system in two steps:

- Firstly, committing to secret inputs and allocating high-level variables corresponding to the inputs.
- secondly, selecting a suitable combination of multiplicative constraints and linear constraints, as well as requesting a random
    scalar in response to the high-level variables already committed [[3]].

Reference [[17]] gives an excellent outline of ZK proofs that use Bulletproofs:

1. The prover commits to a value(s) that they want to prove knowledge of.
1. The prover generates the proof by enforcing the constraints over the committed values and any additional public
 values. The constraints might require the prover to commit to some additional variables.
1. The prover sends the verifier all the commitments made in step 1 and step 2, along with the proof from step 2.
1. The verifier now verifies the proof by enforcing the same constraints over the commitments, plus any public values.


### About Gadgets

Consider a verifiable shuffle: given two lists of committed values ${ x_1, x_2, . . ., x_n}$ and
${ y_1, y_2, . . ., y_n},$ prove that the second list is a permutation of the first. Bunz et al. ([[4], page 5])
mention that
the use of bulletproofs improves the complexity of such a verifiable shuffle to size $\mathcal{O}(log(n))​$ compared to
previous implementation results. Although not referred to as a _gadget_ in the paper, this is in
fact a shuffle gadget. The term *gadget* was used and popularized by the Interstellar team, who introduced gadgets
as building blocks of constraint systems; refer to [[2]].

A _shuffle gadget_ (Figure&nbsp;3) is any function whose outputs are but a permutation of its inputs. By definition of a
permutation, the
number of inputs to a shuffle gadget is always the same as the number of outputs.


<p align="center"><img src="/images/cryptography/r1cs-bulletproofs/simple-shuffle-diagram.png" width="550" /></p>
<div align="center"><b>Figure 3: Simple Shuffle Gadgets with Two Inputs
[<a href="https://medium.com/@cathieyun/building-on-bulletproofs-2faa58af0ba8" title="Building on Bulletproofs">2</a>]
</b></div>


The Interstellar team mentions other gadgets: “merge”, “split” and a “range proof” that are implemented in their
Confidential Assets scheme called the Cloak.
Just as a shuffle gadget creates constraints that prove that
two sets of variables are equal up to a permutation, a range-proof gadget checks that a given value is in the interval
$ [ 0, 2^n ] $
where
$ n $
is the size of the input vector
[[3]].

Gadgets in their simplest form merely receive some variables as inputs and produce corresponding output values. However,
they
may allocate more variables, sometimes called auxiliary variables, for internal use, and produce constraints involving
all these variables. The main advantage of gadgets is that they are composable, thus a more complex
gadget can always be created from a number of single gadgets. Interstellar's Bulletproofs API allows developers to choose their own collection of gadgets suitable for the protocol they wish to develop.


### Interstellar's Concluding Remarks

Cathie Yun reports in [[12]] that their "work on Cloak and Spacesuit is far from complete" and mentions that they
still have two goals to achieve:

- Firstly, in order to "ensure that challenge-based variables cannot be inspected" and prevent the user from
 accidentally breaking soundness of their gadgets, the Bulletproofs protocol needs to be slightly extended, enabling it
 to commit "to a portion of low-level variables using a single vector Pedersen commitment without an overhead of
 additional individual high-level Pedersen commitments" [[12]].
- Secondly, to "improve privacy in Cloak" by enabling "multi-party proving of a single constraint system". That is,
 "building a joint proof of a single constraint system by multiple parties, without sharing their secret inputs with
 each other".

All-in-all, Yun regards constraint systems as "very powerful because they can represent any efficiently
verifiable program" [[2]].


### R1CS Factorization Example for Bulletproofs

In [[17]], Harchandani explores the Dalek Bulletproofs API, using various examples. Of interest
is the factorization problem, which is one out of the six R1CS Bulletproof examples
discussed in the article.
The computational challenge is to "_prove knowledge of factors_ p
_and_ q _of a given number_ r _without revealing the factors_".

Table 3 gives an outline of the description and the code lines of the example. Harchandani's complete
code of this example can be found in [[18]]. Important to note is that the verifier must have an exact copy of the R1CS
circuit used by the prover.

## Conclusions, Observations and Recommendations

Constraint systems form a natural language for most computational problems expressed as arithmetic circuits, and have
found ample application in both zk&#8209;SNARKs and Bulletproofs. The use of ZK proofs for arithmetic circuits and
programmable constraint systems has evolved considerably as illustrated in Table&nbsp;2. Although much work still needs
to be done, Bulletproofs with constraint systems built on them promise to be powerful tools for efficient handling of
verifiable programs. The leverage that developers have, in choosing whatever gadgets they wish to implement, leaves
enough room to build proof systems that have some degree of modularity. Proof system examples by both Dalek and
Harchandani are valuable examples of what can be achieved with Bulletproofs and R1CSs. This framework provides great
opportunities in building blockchain-enabled confidential digital asset schemes.
