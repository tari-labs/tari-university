## Summary

In <a href="https://medium.com/@cathieyun/building-on-bulletproofs-2faa58af0ba8" target="_blank">this post</a> Cathie explains the basics of the Bulletproofs zero knowledge proof protocol. She then goes further to explain specific applications built on top of Bulletproofs, which can be used for range proofs or constraint system proofs. The constraint system proof protocol was
used to build a confidential assets scheme called Cloak and a confidential smart contract language called ZkVM.
