## Purpose

As networks with large numbers of geographically distributed nodes evolve, issues such as processing delays and data
transfers may
arise, potentially creating an environment for adversarial attacks. Network models and methods of analysis of a networked ecosystem
need to be developed to capture the evolution and dynamics.

## Definitions

- From **Lexico:** The mathematical analysis of complex working procedures in terms of a network of related activities [[1]].
- From **Wikipedia:**  Network analysis is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and
  graph theory. It characterizes networked structures in terms of *nodes* (individual actors, people, or things within
  the network) and the *ties*, *edges*, or *links* (relationships or interactions) that connect them [[2]].
