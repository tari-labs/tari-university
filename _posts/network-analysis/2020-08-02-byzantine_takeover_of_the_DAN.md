## Introduction

This investigation aims to provide answers to questions posed about the workings of the Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN)
environment. It covers probabilistic attack vector with regard to the total nodes, compromised nodes, committee size and
Byzantine Fault-tolerance (BFT) threshold.

The investigation attempts to answer the following question:
*What is the percentage chance of controlling the majority of nodes in a random sample with varying quantities of the total
number of nodes, committee size, bad nodes and BFT threshold?*

## Tari Digital Assets Network

The Tari Digital Assets Network (DAN) forms part of the Tari second layer, where the management of all digital
asset interactions takes place.

These interactions are processed and validated by committees of special nodes, called Validator Nodes<sup>[def][vn~]</sup>
(VNs). Management
of Digital Assets (DAs) involves state changes and ensures enforcement of the rules that govern assets contracts.
Thus, all actions on this network are due to the interactions of the VNs.
The registration of VNs occurs on the base layer. To prevent Sybil attacks, they commit collateral. If
proved that the VN engaged in malicious behavior, the VN will lose its collateral.

An Asset Issuer <sup>[def][ai~]</sup> (AI) would then issue DAs and draw up a contract. The AI will dictate the size of
the committee of VNs for a particular DA. The AI will also have the ability to nominate a trusted node to
form part of the VN committee for the DA [[1]].

### Kademlia

Kademlia was designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières in 2002 [[2]]. It is a distributed hash table, used for
decentralized, peer-to-peer computer networks.

### Node ID

A node selects an $n$-bit ID, given to nodes on the network. Node IDs have uniformly distributed numbers.
A node's position is determined by a unique prefix of its ID, which forms a tree structure, with node IDs as leaves.

The bit length of the node ID should be sufficiently large to make collisions unlikely when using a uniformly
distributed random number generator [[3]].

#### Bootstrapping a Node

A bootstrap node is a node listed on a predetermined list, and serves as the first point of contact for a new node. The
node bootstrapping process is as follows:

- To establish itself on the network without any known contacts, a node needs to contact at least one bootstrap node,
  requesting an introduction to the network.
- A node ID is generated for the joining node.
- The new node contacts other nodes of which it is aware.
- The new node sends a lookup request with its newly generated node ID.
- The contacted nodes return the nodes they know about that are closest.
- The new nodes are added to the routing table, and contacting begins.
- The process continues until the joining node is unable to locate any closer nodes.

This
*self-lookup* has two effects:

- it allows the node to learn about nodes closer to itself; and
- it populates other nodes'
  routing tables with the node's ID [[3]].

#### XOR Metric

The Kademlia paper, published in 2002 [[2]], contained the novel idea of using the XOR operator to determine the
distance and therefore the arrangement of peers within the network.

Through the XOR metric, a distance is captured. The lookup procedure allows nodes to locate other nodes,
given a node ID [[3]].

## Implementation

The following calculations were done using the [Tari Labs Modelling Repository](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling).

### Crude Monte Carlo Simulation

#### Proving the Law of Large Numbers

With the Crude Monte Carlo technique, to gain precision, the number of samples can be increased. Thus, before
calculating the probability and drawing comparisons, the sample size, number of draws within an experiment, and the
number of experiments can be varied to find an optimal amount.

Below is the input data inserted into the [python programme](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/scenarios/crude_monte_carlo_simulation.py)
with dependencies [network setup](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/utils/network_setup.py) and [random distribution](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/utils/rand_dist.py), where the number of draws within an experiment is $10​$, and the number of experiments is $10​$:

```Text
What is the total amount of nodes? 100
What is the amount of bad nodes? 60
How many nodes are to be drawn? 3
What is the BFT threshold within the committee? 2
What is the number of draws within an experiment? 10
How many experiments? 10
Do you know the theoretical mean? Y|N: Y
What is the theoretical mean? 0.649474335188621
```

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/small_no_exp_convergence.png" width="700" /></p>

Below is the input data inserted into the python programme, where the number of draws within an experiment is $1,000​$
and the number of experiments is $1,000​$:

```Text
What is the total amount of nodes? 100
What is the amount of bad nodes? 60
How many nodes are to be drawn? 3
What is the BFT threshold within the committee? 2
What is the number of draws within an experiment? 1,000
How many experiments? 1,000
Do you know the theoretical mean? Y|N: Y
What is the theoretical mean? 0.649474335188621
```

In each graph, the cumulative probabilities calculated for normal, uniform, Poisson and hypergeometric distribution are
plotted against the number of experiments. The bold blue line represents the mean calculated from theoretical data.

In the first graph, where the experiments and draws are equal to $10$, there is weak convergence. In the second graph, where the
experiments and draws are equal to $1,000$, the  Law of Large Numbers (LLN) is proved; as the sample size grows, convergence
with the statistical mean is achieved.

#### Individual Probabilities

The following graph highlights the varying probabilities of each experiment conducted for the hypergeometric distribution.
The mean of this distribution provides us with the average of the probabilities, which can then be compared to the calculated
theoretical mean.

From a comparison of the mean probability of each distribution with the theoretical mean, it can be seen that the
distribution type that closely mimics the theoretical result is hypergeometric.

Hypergeometric distribution is where there is no replacement, i.e. nodes are drawn simultaneously, distinguished and
not returned to the pool of total nodes.

### Statistical Calculation

Literature about [BFT threshold](/consensus-mechanisms/Introduction-to-Applications-of-Byzantine-Consensus-Mechanisms) advises
the number of good nodes to be at least $\frac{2}{3} \cdot n+1​$, where $n​$ is the number of nodes. In the calculations
that follow, BFT threshold of, for example, $67​$% of N, is implemented with rounding up to ensure that at least that
fraction is obtained. In this sense, $67​$% of N simulates $\frac{2}{3} \cdot n+1​$.

#### Variation of Total Nodes

The variables and results are below:

- N (total number of nodes in the network) = $100, 300, 500, 1000$
- m (number of bad actors) = $60$% of N
- T (BFT threshold) = $67$% of N
- n (committee size) = ranging from $1$ to $1,000$

The above graph was calculated using Python ([variations of N](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/scenarios/N_variations.py) with dependencies [hypergeometric distribution](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/utils/hyper_dist_prob.py)). Below is a sample of the data where there is a total of 100. The highlighted data was previously used in the Crude Monte Carlo Simulation when supplying the theoretical mean.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/variation_of_total_nodes .png" width="700" /></p>
From a plot of committee size versus probability with a change in $N$, the total number of nodes, it can be seen that
the probability is lower with respect to the committee size when $N$ is smaller.

#### Variation of Byzantine Fault-tolerance Threshold

The variables and results are below:

  - N (total number of nodes in the network) = $100$
  - m (number of bad actors) = $60$% of N
  - T (BFT threshold) = $50$%, $55$%, $60$%, $67$% of N
  - n (committee size) = ranging from $1$ to $100$

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/variation_of_bft_threshold.png" width="700" /></p>

The above graph was calculated using Python
([variations of BFT](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/scenarios/T_variations.py) with dependencies
[hypergeometric distribution](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/utils/hyper_dist_prob.py)). From a plot
of committee size versus probability where the number of nodes remains at $100$ with a change in $T$, the BFT
threshold, ranging from $50$% to $67$%, it can be seen that When the BFT threshold is $50$% and $55$%, the probability
is low when the committee size is small; as the committee size increases, the probability increases, and tends to $1$.
The probability is higher for the case where the BFT threshold is $50$% than when the probability is $55$%.

When the BFT threshold is $60$%, the probability decreases from $0.63$ to approximately $0.59$, where it remains constant.

When the BFT threshold is $65$% and $67$%, the probability decreases from $0.38$ and tends to zero. This confirms the
BFT threshold of $\frac{2}{3} \cdot n+1$ as per literature.

#### Variation of Total Number of Nodes with Committee Size 10

The variables and results are below:

- N (total number of nodes in the network) = ranging from $10$ to $350$
- m (number of bad actors) = $60$% of N
- T (BFT threshold) = $67$% of N
- n (committee size) = $10$

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/committee_size_10.png" width="900" /></p>

The above graph was calculated using Excel
([variations of N with n fixed](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/other/variation_of_N_n_fixed.xlsx)). For the
graph showing varying probabilities with respect to the total number of network nodes, where the committee size is $10$,
the probability dramatically increases when the total nodes is $3$ times more than the committee size and onwards. The
probability plateaus at $0.35$.

#### Variation of Total Number of Nodes with Committee Size 100

The variables and results are below:

- N (total number of nodes in the network) = ranging from $100$ to $1,300$
- m (number of bad actors) = $60$% of N
- T (BFT threshold) = $67​$% of N
- n (committee size) = $100$

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/committee_size_100.png" width="900" /></p>

The above graph was calculated using Excel
([variations of N with n fixed](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/other/variation_of_N_n_fixed.xlsx)).
From this and the previous graph, it can be seen that probabilities are significantly lower when the committee size is
$100$ compared to when it is $10$. There is an increase in probability up to a network size of $700$, albeit, not as steep as the
change when the committee size is $10$. The probability plateaus at $0.08$.

The larger the committee size, the fewer dramatic changes there are in the probability.

#### Variation of Bad Nodes with Committee Size 10 and 100

The variables and results are below:

- N (total number of nodes in the network) = ranging from $10$ and $100$ to $50,000$
- m (number of bad actors) = $10$%, $20$%, $30$%, $40$%, $50$%, $60$%, $70$%, $80$% and $90$% of N
- T (BFT threshold) = $67$% of N
- n (committee size) = $10$ and $100$

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/probability_when_committee_100_90.png" width="900" /></p>

The above graphs were calculated using Excel
([bad node variation where n is 100](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/other/bad_nodes_variation_10_10.xlsx)). These
graphs show varying probabilities when the percentage of bad nodes is $20$, $40$, $60$ and $90$. The value when the
probability plateaus is used to construct the following graph for both committee sizes $10$ and $100$.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/network-analysis/probability_bad_nodes_10_100.png" width="850" /></p>

The above graph was calculated using Excel
([bad node percentage at 10 and 100](https://github.com/tari-labs/modelling/blob/master/other/bad_node_percentage_10_100.xlsx)). The
graph shows changes in the probability due to changes in percentage of bad nodes when the committee size is $10$ and $100$.  When
the committee size is $10$, there is a change in probability when the bad node percentage is between $30$ and $80$.  
When the committee size is $100$, there is a steep increase in the probability when the bad node percentage is between
$50$ and $80$. When the committee size is $100$, the probability remains lower as the bad node percentage increases and
has a steeper gradient when the change in probability occurs. Whereas, when the committee size is $10$, the probability
begins to increase at a lower percentage of bad nodes.

## Conclusions and Remarks

With regard to the Crude Monte Carlo Simulation, at this building block stage, probabilities were calculated and
distributions of nodes within the network illustrated.

With regard to the statistical calculation, comments can be made for each of the varied parameters.

- Total nodes in the network: The smaller the pool of total nodes in the network, the lower the probability of bad
actors controlling the network. However, the probability difference is near negligible if the committee size is large.
This parameter will also be difficult to control, and the network will be ever-increasing. This can be seen in the
graph in [Variation of Total Nodes](#variation-of-total-nodes).
- BFT threshold: This threshold should be at least  $\frac{2}{3} \cdot n+1$ as per literature. This can be seen in the
graph in [Variation of Byzantine Fault-tolerance Threshold](#variation-of-byzantine-fault-tolerance-threshold).
- Committee size: The larger the committee size, the lower the probability of bad actors controlling the network. This can
be seen in the graph in
[Variation of Total Number of Nodes with Committee Size 10](#variation-of-total-number-of-nodes-with-committee-size-10)
and [Variation of Total Number of Nodes with Committee Size 100](#variation-of-total-number-of-nodes-with-committee-size-100).
- Bad nodes: While this variable cannot be controlled, the probability of bad actors controlling the network can remain
low, as the percentage of bad nodes increases if the committee size is approximately $100$ or larger. This can be seen in the
graphs in [Variation of Bad Nodes with Committee Size 10 and 100](#variation-of-bad-nodes-with-committee-size-10-and-100)
