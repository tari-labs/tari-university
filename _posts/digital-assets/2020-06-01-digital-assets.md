## Purpose

"All digital assets provide value, but not all digital assets are valued equally" [[1]].

## Definitions

### Digital Assets

- From **Simplicable**: A digital asset is something that has value and can be owned but has no physical presence [[2]].

- From **The Digital Beyond**: A digital asset is content that is stored in digital form or an online account, owned by an individual. The associated
  digital data are classified as intangible, personal property, as long as they stay digital, otherwise they quickly
  become tangible personal property [[3]].

- From **Wikipedia**: A digital asset, in essence, is anything that exists in a binary format and comes with the right to use. Data that do
  not possess that right are not considered assets. Digital assets come in many forms and may be stored on many types of
  digital appliances which are, or will be in existence once technology progresses to accommodate for the conception of
  new modalities which would be able to carry digital assets; notwithstanding the proprietorship of the physical device
  onto which the digital asset is located [[4]].

### Non-fungible Tokens

- From **Wikipedia**: A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible
  tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and many network or utility
  tokens that are fungible in nature. NFTs are used to create verifiable digital scarcity, for example in several
  specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto-collectibles and crypto-gaming [[5]].

- From **BTC Manager**: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are blockchain tokens that are designed to be distinguishable from each other. Using unique
  metadata, avatars, individual token IDs, and custody chains, NFTs are created to ensure that no two NFT tokens are
  identical. This is because they exist to store information rather than value, unlike their fungible counterparts [[6]].
