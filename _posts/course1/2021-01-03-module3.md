selftest:
  - title: What is the double-spend problem?
    content: It’s trivial to make perfect copies of digital transactions. For any electronic money system, the double-spend problem refers to trying to prevent the transaction “Alice pays $100” from being used over and over again. This is typically solved using a centralised ledger (i.e. a bank). Bitcoin solves the double-spend problem without requiring a centralised authority controlling the ledger.
  - title: What are the risks of having a central authority controlling the ledger?
    content: (1) You have to trust the central authority not to cheat or steal from you. (2) They could censor your transactions if they decided they didn’t like you or with whom you were transacting.
  - title: What stops the double-spend problem in physical cash?
    content: Trick question! Is the double-spend problem even solved with cash? Only partially. With cash, we don’t call it double-spending, we call it counterfeiting. Ridges on the sides of coins, watermarks, RFIDs and high-precision printing are just some of the techniques invented to try and prevent counterfeiting and hence the double-spend problem in cash.
