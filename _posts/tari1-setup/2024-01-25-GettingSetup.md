Before you start developing on Tari, you'll need to set up your environment.
Here's some things you'll need
1. A computer running Linux, macOS or Windows
2. A text editor or IDE. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Docker (How to set up Docker on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/))
4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setting up your environment
Begin by pulling the tari testing docker image from Quay.

```bash
docker pull quay.io/tarilabs/dan-testing
```

Start the container by running 

```bash
docker run quay.io/tarilabs/dan-testing
```

This will start up a base node, miner and validator node as well as create some 
accounts and a Tari Asset Wallet.
