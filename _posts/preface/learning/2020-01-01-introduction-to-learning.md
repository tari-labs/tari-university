With a field that is rapidly developing it is very important to stay updated with the latest trends, protocols and products that have incorporated this technology.

List of resources available to garner your knowledge in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency Domains is presented in the following paths:

|      | Learning Path                                    | Description                                                  |

| 1    | [Blockchain Basics](./blockchain-basics.md)      | Blockchain Basics provides a broad and easily understood explanation of blockchain technology, as well as the history of value itself. Having an understanding of the value is especially important in grasping how blockchain and cryptocurrencies have the potential to reshape the financial industry. |
| 2    | [Mimblewimble Implementation](./mimblewimble.md) | Mimblewimble is a blockchain protocol that focuses on privacy through the implementation of confidential transactions. It enables a greatly simplified blockchain in which all spent transactions can be pruned, resulting in a much smaller blockchain footprint and efficient base node validation. The blockchain consists only of block-headers, remaining Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) with their range proofs and an unprunable transaction kernel per transaction. |
| 3    | [Bulletproofs](./bulletproofs.md)                | Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup. A bulletproof can be used to convince a verifier that an encrypted plaintext is well formed. For example, prove that an encrypted number is in a given range, without revealing anything else about the number. |
