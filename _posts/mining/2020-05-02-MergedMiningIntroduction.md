description: Merged mining is the act of using work done on another blockchain (the Parent) on one or more than one Auxiliary blockchain and to accept it as valid on its own chain, using Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW), which is the relationship between two blockchains for one to trust the other's work as their own.
