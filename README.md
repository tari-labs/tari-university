# Introduction 

Welcome to Tari Labs University

Our aim: Build a learning platform and populate it with content

We hope to make this a learning experience for us at Tari Labs: as a means to grow our knowledge base and internal expertise or as a refresher-- but we think this will also be an excellent resource for anyone interested in the myriad of disciplines required to understand blockchain technology.  

We would like this platform to be a place of learning- accessible to anyone, irrespective of their degree of expertise. Our aim is to cover a wide range of topics that are relevant to the Tari space, starting at a beginner level, extending down a path of deeper complexity. 

## Errors, Comments and Contributions 

We want this collection of educational presentations and videos to be collaborative affair.

This extends to our presentations; we are learning along with you: our content may not be perfect first time around- so we invite you to alert us to errors and issues, or better yet, if you know how to make a pull request to contribute a fix, write the correction and use a pull request.
 
As much as this learning platform is called Tari Labs University and will see input from many internal contributors and external experts, we would like you to contribute to new material, be it in the form of a suggestion of topics, varying the skill levels of presentations, or posting presentations that you may feel will benefit us as a growing community. In the words of Yoda, “Always pass on what you have learned”.
