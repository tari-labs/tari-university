### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on the Jekyll website.
